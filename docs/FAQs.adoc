== 'Configuring Sandbox, please wait'

This error occurs in the embedded sandbox in the right pane for a course for a couple of reasons:

. User is not connected to the sandbox for the course.
. VPN connection is blocking access.

=== Solution

In most cases it is a sandbox connection issue. In the same browser window where you are signed in to GraphAcademy, open a new tab and sign in to sandbox.neo4j.com using the same credentials you use for signing into GraphAcademy.
Then, if you simply refresh the GraphAcademy course page, the issue should resolve.

If you are connected to a VPN, you may have to disconnect to access the embedded browser from the course.
