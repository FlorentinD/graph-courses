= Welcome to {course_title} on GraphAcademy!

Hi {user_name},

We are pleased to welcome you to the link:{base_url}{course_link}[{course_title}] course on GraphAcademy.

There is no time limit to the course.  You can access your courses at any time by signing into your account at link:{base_url}[{base_url}^] and click **My Courses**.

**Your Sandbox Instance**

As this is an interactive course, we have also created a new Sandbox instance on link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j Sandbox^] with the following credentials:

[subs="attributes"]
    Browser URL: {sandbox_scheme}://{sandbox_host}:{sandbox_port}
    Bolt URL: {sandbox_scheme}://{sandbox_host}:{sandbox_boltPort}
    Username: {sandbox_username}
    Password: {sandbox_password}


This sandbox instance is completely free, but be aware, it will expire in 3 days if no further action is taken.
You can extend the sandbox for an additional 7 days.
If you have not completed the course and your sandbox has expired, we will automatically create a new one for you when you continue the course and it will be populated with the default data for the course.

You can either log into link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j Sandbox^] with the same credentials as you have for GraphAcademy or use the connection details to connect in Neo4j Browser or from a development application.

For more information on using the Neo4j Driver in the language of your choice, you can visit the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/[Drivers & Languages Developer guide^] or link:https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-desktop[add a new remote connection to Neo4j Desktop.^]
