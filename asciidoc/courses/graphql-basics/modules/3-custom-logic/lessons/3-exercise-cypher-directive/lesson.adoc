= Exercise: Exploring the @cypher Directive
:order: 3


We saw how powerful the Cypher directive can be for adding custom logic to our GraphQL API. For this exercise first be sure to follow along with the steps above to make use of the `@cypher` schema directive in your GraphQL type definitions. If you run into any issues you can refer to https://codesandbox.io/s/github/johnymontana/training-v3/tree/master/modules/graphql-apis/supplemental/code/03-graphql-apis-custom-logic/end?file=/.env[this Codesandbox^] with all the code we added in this lesson.

For this exercise you will be adding a `similar` field to the `Book` type which will return similar books. How you determine similarity is up to you. Perhaps consider order co-occurence (books purchased together) or user reviews? First, think about how to query for similar books using Cypher, testing in Neo4j Browser. Then add the query as a `@cypher` directive field to the `Book` type. Advanced users may wish to explore the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current[Graph Data Science Library^] to leverage graph algorithms. For example, here's how we can use the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/jaccard/[Jaccard Similarity function^] to find similar books using book subjects:

[source,GraphQL]
----
# schema.graphql

extend type Book {
  similar: [Book] @cypher(statement: """
  MATCH (this)-[:ABOUT]->(s:Subject)
  WITH this, COLLECT(id(s)) AS s1
  MATCH (b:Book)-[:ABOUT]->(s:Subject) WHERE b <> this
  WITH this, b, s1, COLLECT(id(s)) AS s2
  WITH b, gds.alpha.similarity.jaccard(s2, s2) AS jaccard
  ORDER BY jaccard DESC
  RETURN b LIMIT 1
  """)
}
----

Your solution will enable clients of the GraphQL API to include the `similar` field in the selection set and view similar books:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  books(where: { title: "Graph Algorithms" }) {
    title
    similar {
      title
    }
  }
}
----

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "Graph Algorithms",
        "similar": [
          {
            "title": "Inspired"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

== Summary

In this lesson, we explored two methods for adding custom logic to our GraphQL API: the `@cypher` schema directive and custom resolvers. In the next lesson we address adding authorization rules to our API using the `@auth` directive and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
