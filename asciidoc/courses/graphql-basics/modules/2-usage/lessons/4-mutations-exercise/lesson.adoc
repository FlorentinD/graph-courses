In this leson we will explore how to query our GraphQL API using the generated Query fields, but first let's clear our database and load some initial sample data.


== Clear The Database

[WARNING]
TODO: We could run this as part of the reset/seed script



First, clear your database by running this Cypher statement in Neo4j Browser. You can find the link to open Neo4j Browser in Neo4j Sandbox - look for the green "Open" button.

> Be sure you're running this query in the correct Neo4j instance as this will delete all data in the database!

== Adding Sample Data

Now, in GraphQL Playground running in your Codesandbox, run the following GraphQL mutation to add some sample data:

[source,GraphQL]
----
mutation {
  createBooks(
    input: [
      {
        isbn: "1492047686"
        title: "Graph Algorithms"
        price: 37.48
        description: "Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j"
      }
      {
        isbn: "1119387507"
        title: "Inspired"
        price: 21.38
        description: "How to Create Tech Products Customers Love"
      }
      {
        isbn: "190962151X"
        title: "Ross Poldark"
        price: 15.52
        description: "Ross Poldark is the first novel in Winston Graham's sweeping saga of Cornish life in the eighteenth century."
      }
    ]
  ) {
    books {
      title
    }
  }

  createCustomers(
    input: [
      {
        username: "EmilEifrem7474"
        reviews: {
          create: {
            rating: 5
            text: "Best overview of graph data science!"
            book: { connect: { where: { isbn: "1492047686" } } }
          }
        }
        orders: {
          create: {
            books: { connect: { where: { title: "Graph Algorithms" } } }
            shipTo: {
              create: {
                address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"
                location: {
                  latitude: 37.5635980790
                  longitude: -122.322243272725
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      {
        username: "BookLover123"
        reviews: {
          create: [
            {
              rating: 4
              text: "Beautiful depiction of Cornwall."
              book: { connect: { where: { isbn: "190962151X" } } }
            }
          ]
        }
        orders: {
          create: {
            books: {
              connect: [
                { where: { title: "Ross Poldark" } }
                { where: { isbn: "1119387507" } }
                { where: { isbn: "1492047686" } }
              ]
            }
            shipTo: {
              create: {
                address: "Nordenskiöldsgatan 24, 211 19 Malmö, Sweden"
                location: { latitude: 55.6122270502, longitude: 12.99481772774 }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  ) {
    customers {
      username
    }
  }
}

Now, the data in our database will look something like this:

image::02bookdata4.png[Books, orders, customers, and reviews,width=500,align=center]

Now that we have some data loaded and we've reviewed how to add data using GraphQL mutations and the Neo4j GraphQL Library, let's see how we can query that data using GraphQL.

== Querying Data With GraphQL

We will review some examples now using the data we just loaded above, refer to the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/schema/queries/[Neo4j GraphQL Library documentation] for more information and examples.

=== GraphQL Query Fields

By default, each type defined in the GraphQL type definitions will have a GraphQL Query field generated and added to the Query type as the pluralized name of the type (for example the type `Movie` becomes a Query field `movies`). Each query field is an entry point into the GraphQL API. Since GraphQL types are mapped to node labels in Neo4j, you can think of the Query field as the starting point for a traversal through the graph.

Let's start with an example, querying for all books and their titles.

[source, GraphQL]
----
{
  books {
    title
  }
}
----

If we loaded our sample data correctly we will see the follow result:

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "Graph Algorithms"
      },
      {
        "title": "Inspired"
      },
      {
        "title": "Ross Poldark"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

The response data matches the shape of our GraphQL query - as we add more fields to the GraphQL selection set those fields are included in the response object. This query:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  books {
    title
    description
    price
  }
}
----

produces the following result:

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "Graph Algorithms",
        "description": "Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j",
        "price": 37.48
      },
      {
        "title": "Inspired",
        "description": "How to Create Tech Products Customers Love",
        "price": 21.38
      },
      {
        "title": "Ross Poldark",
        "description": "Ross Poldark is the first novel in Winston Graham's sweeping saga of Cornish life in the eighteenth century.",
        "price": 15.52
      }
    ]
  }
}
----


Traversals through the graph are expressed by adding nested fields to the GraphQL selection set.

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  books {
    title
    reviews {
      rating
      text
      author {
        username
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "Graph Algorithms",
        "reviews": [
          {
            "rating": 5,
            "text": "Best overview of graph data science!",
            "author": {
              "username": "EmilEifrem7474"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Inspired",
        "reviews": []
      },
      {
        "title": "Ross Poldark",
        "reviews": [
          {
            "rating": 4,
            "text": "Beautiful depiction of Cornwall.",
            "author": {
              "username": "BookLover123"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Each generated Query field accepts two arguments `where` and `options`. The `where` argument is used to specify filtering arguments while `options` is used for sorting and pagination.
