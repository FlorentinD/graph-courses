= Sorting and Pagination
:order: 5


A sorting input type is generated for each type in the GraphQL type definitions, allowing for Query results to be sorted by each field using the `options` field argument.

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  books(options: { sort: { price: DESC } }) {
    title
    price
  }
}
----

[source,JSON,role=nocopy]
----
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "title": "Graph Algorithms",
        "price": 37.48
      },
      {
        "title": "Inspired",
        "price": 21.38
      },
      {
        "title": "Ross Poldark",
        "price": 15.52
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

We can also sort in ascending order and pass multiple sort input objects to order by multiple fields. See the https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/schema/sorting/[documentation] for more information.

Page-based pagination is available by passing `skip` and `limit` values as part of the `options` argument. For example:

[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  books(options: { sort: { price: DESC }, limit: 1, skip: 0 }) {
    title
    price
  }
}
