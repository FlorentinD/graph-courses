== Question 2

For the GraphQL schema we created in this lesson, which of the follow GraphQL mutations would create an address for an already existing order?

- [x] `mutation {
  createAddresses(
    input: {
      address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"
      order: { connect: { where: { orderID: "123" } } }
    }
  ) {
    addresses {
      address
    }
  }
}`
- [ ] `mutation {
  createAddresses(
    input: {
      address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"
      order: {
        create: { books: { connect: { where: { title: "Graph Algorithms" } } } }
      }
    }
  ) {
    addresses {
      address
    }
  }
}`
- [ ] `CREATE (a:Address {address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"}) MATCH (o:Order {orderID: "123"}) CREATE (a)<-[:SHIPS_TO]-(o)`
