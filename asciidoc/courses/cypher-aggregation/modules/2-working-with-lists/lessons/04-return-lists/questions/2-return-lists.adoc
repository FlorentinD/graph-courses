= 2. Creating list from string

Suppose we have a string in our CSV file that has a field that has values like this:

----
"abc#def#ghi#jkl"
----

We want to transform this string into a list where the list will contain four strings:

----
["abc","def","ghi","jkl"]
----

Use the dropdown below to select the correct `RETURN` clause to transform the string.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.

WITH "abc#def#ghi#jkl" as InputString
/*RETURN split(InputString,"#") as OutputList*/
----

* [ ] `RETURN sub(InputString | "#") as OutputList`
* [ ] `RETURN split(InputString | "#") as OutputList`
* [ ] `RETURN sub(InputString,"#") as OutputList`
* [x] `RETURN split(InputString,"#") as OutputList`
