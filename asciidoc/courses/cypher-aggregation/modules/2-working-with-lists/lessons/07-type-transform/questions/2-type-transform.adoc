= 2. Creating list from string

Suppose we have a list that has these values:

----
["abc", false, 1, 1.5,null, datetime(), date(), LocalDateTime(), point({x: 2.3, y: 4.5})]
----

If you use `toBooleanList() on this list, how many elements are set to null?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [ ] 6
* [x] 7
* [ ] 9

.Hint
====
With the list element transformation functions, null elements remain null.

A numeric value of 0 is transformed to false and a numeric value of 1 is transformed to true.
