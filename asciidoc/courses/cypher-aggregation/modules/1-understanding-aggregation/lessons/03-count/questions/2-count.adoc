MATCH (u:User)-[:RATED]->(m:Movie)
/*select:RETURN  count (DISTINCT m.title)*/

* [ ] `RETURN  count (*)`

* [x] `RETURN  count (DISTINCT m.title)`

.Hint
====
The query returns all user/movie node pairs with the `RATED` relationship. Users have rated multiple movies.
How can you just count the number of unique movie titles that have been rated?
