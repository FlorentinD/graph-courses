We want a count of the movie titles in the graph that have been rated.

Use the dropdown below to select the correct `RETURN` clause.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:RATED]->(m:Movie)
/*RETURN  count (DISTINCT m.title)*/
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, u.name
----

* [ ] `RETURN  count (*)`
* [ ] `RETURN  count (DISTINCT *)`
* [ ] `RETURN  count (m.title)`
* [x] `RETURN  count (DISTINCT m.title)`


[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
The query returna all user/movie node pairs with the `RATED` relationship. Users have rated multiple movies.
How can you just count the number of unique movie titles that have been rated?
