= 2. Ordering results returned

Here is a query that returns  values to the client for movies released in 2000 and 2001.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE  2000 <= m.year <= 2001
MATCH (d:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
RETURN m.year AS Year, m.title AS Title, m.released  AS ReleaseDate, collect(DISTINCT a.name) AS Actors,
collect(DISTINCT d.name) AS Directors
----

The results are returned so that all rows for the year 2000 are returned first, then all rows for the year 2001.
When results are returned for aggregated results such as Actors and Directors, what is m.year considered?
