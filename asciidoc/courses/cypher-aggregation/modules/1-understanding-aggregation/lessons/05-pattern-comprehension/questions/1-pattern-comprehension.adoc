[.question,role=multiple_choice]
= 1. Pattern comprehension syntax

Suppose you have a query that retrieves Movie nodes:

[source,Partial,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
----

What Cypher syntax elements must you use to return a list of actors for the movie using pattern comprehension: (select all that apply)

* [x] []
* [x] |
* [ ] `collect()`
* [ ] `list()`

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
You must explicitly demarcate the list returned with this syntax element.
You also use this syntax element to separate the pattern and the value that will be used to create the list returned.
====

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
You use "[]" to explicitly return the list and you use "|" to separate the pattern and the value that will be extracted from the pattern for the list.
