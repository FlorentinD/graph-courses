== Using `avg()` to average values

Cypher `avg()` returns the average of all values retrieved during aggregation.
The values must be numeric types or durations.
The result returned is a float.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE m.year = 2000
RETURN avg(m.revenue) as AvgRevenue
----

Notice that for this Cypher code, the Movie node data is aggregated to create the average of the revenue property values.

If the values used for `avg()` contain nulls, then that element is not used in the calculation.

Here is an example:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH [1,3, null] as Nums
UNWIND Nums AS x
RETURN avg(x)
----

In this query, only 2 elements are used to sum the values and then divide by 2 to create the average returned.

Here is another example where we use a subquery to filter the data:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL {
  MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.year = 2000
  RETURN m ORDER BY m.imdbRating DESC LIMIT 10
}
MATCH  (:User)-[r:RATED]->(m)
RETURN m.title as Movie, avg(r.rating) AS AverageRating
----

The subquery is demarcated by the {}s here.
The subquery returns 10 Movie nodes of movies released in 2000 with the highest imdbRating.
Then with these 10 movies, it determines the average rating for each of these 10 movies.

=== `avg()` and eager aggregation

A best practice in a query is to aggregate early. Here is an example where we do so:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WITH avg(m.imdbVotes) as AverageVote
MATCH (m2:Movie)
WHERE m2.year = 2010 AND m2.imdbVotes > AverageVote
RETURN AverageVote AS OverallAverageVote, m2.title AS Title , m2.imdbVotes AS AverageVote
----

The call to `avg()` requires that all movie nodes are retrieved before the next step in the execution plan.

Here is another example:

[source,cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (m:Movie)
WITH avg(m.imdbVotes) as AverageVote
MATCH (m2:Movie)
WHERE m2.year = 2010 AND m2.imdbVotes > AverageVote
RETURN AverageVote AS OverallAverageVote, m2.title AS Title , m2.imdbVotes AS AverageVote
----

For this query, we first calculate the average rating for all movies that Misty Williams rated.
Then we use this calculated value, Average as a test for the second `MATCH`.

=== Using `avg()` for durations

In addition to aggregating property values for nodes retrieved as a sum, you can also aggregate durations and total them.
A Neo4j duration type is used to calculate the amount of time between two dates or times.

Here is an example, modified from the query in the previous lesson.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE
a.born IS NOT NULL
AND a.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
WITH count(a) AS NumActors, collect(duration.between(date(a.born), date())) AS Ages
UNWIND Ages AS x
RETURN  sum(x), sum(x)/NumActors, avg(x)
----

In this query, we retrieve all Actor nodes with a name that begins with "Tom".
We collect the durations between the birth date and now.
We then `UNWIND` the list of durations to aggregate the values using `avg()`.
We return the the sum, calculated average, and result of `avg()`.

== Summary

In this lesson, you reviewed and learned how aggregation is used to average data in your Cypher queries.
In the next Challenge, you will create a query  that averages data.
