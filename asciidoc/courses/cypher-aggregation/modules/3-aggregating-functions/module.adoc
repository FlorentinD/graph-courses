:sandbox: true

== Module overview

Cypher supports a number of functions that must aggregate data to return a single value.
These functions are called aggregating functions.

In this module, you will learn about the most widely-used aggregating functions:

* `sum()`
* `avg()` and `stddev()`
* `min()` and `max()`
*  percentages and percentiles
