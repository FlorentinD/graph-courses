== Course Description

In this course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Node.js projects.

We will follow the steps to create an instance of the Neo4j JavaScript Driver, learn about sessions and transactions, and use that knowledge to build a REST API with link:https://expressjs.com/[Express.js^].

The project also serves a pre-built Single Page Application (SPA) that calls the API.
As you work through the course, you will replace the hardcoded API responses with data from Neo4j.

The course automatically creates a new `recommendations` sandbox within link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Neo4j Sandbox] that you will use throughout the course.
