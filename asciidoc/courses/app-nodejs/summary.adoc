= Course Summary

Congratulations!
In this course, you have modified an existing project to query the https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations[Recommendations dataset^].

In the first module, **Project Setup** you configured the project and stored the Neo4j Sandbox credentials within the project's environment variables for use at a later stage.

In the second module, **The Neo4j JavaScript Driver**, you learned all about the  Neo4j Driver and how it should be used within an application.
This included installing the `neo4j-driver` dependency, building a connection string, creating a Driver instance using the `driver()` method and verifying that the credentials used to create the driver instance were correct.

In the third module, **Interacting with Neo4j**, you learned how to open new database sessions, execute read and write transactions and how to consume the results.
You also learned how to handle potential errors thrown by the driver, and gained hands on experience by implementing these skills within the project.

In the final module, **Project Backlog**, you honed your skills by modifying the remaining service classes to retrieve.

You should now have a fully working application that you can share with your friends or colleagues, and all of the knowledge required to build one of your own.

We wish you good luck on your journey with Neo4j!
