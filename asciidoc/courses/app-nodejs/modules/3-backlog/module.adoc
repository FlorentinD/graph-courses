= Project Backlog


Now that we have covered everything that we need to know, we can practise our skills by implementing the remainder of the backlog.

Throughout this module you will be provided with type of transaction and Cypher query for each lesson, but it will be up to you to complete the code that surrounds the query.
If you get stuck at any point, you can reveal the solution under the *Working Solution* header.
