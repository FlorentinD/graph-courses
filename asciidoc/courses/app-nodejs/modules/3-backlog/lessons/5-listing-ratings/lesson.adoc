= Listing Ratings
:type: challenge
:test-number: 13
:branch: 13-listing-ratings

The last remaining element on the Movie page is the list of ratings on the right-hand side of the page.
Although the count in the header is now accurate, the ratings being returned by the API are still hardcoded.

The list of ratings is populated by the `forMovie()` method in the link:{repository-blob}/src/modules/rating.service.js[`RatingService`^], which currently returns a hardcoded list of ratings.
