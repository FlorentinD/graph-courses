= Your Neo4j Sandbox

As part of this course, a Neo4j Sandbox instance has been created for you with the recommendations dataset.
This dataset contains all of the details required to populate the Neoflix website.


== What is Neo4j Sandbox?

Neo4j Sandbox is a free service that allows you to create pre-populated Neo4j instances completely free of charge.
Neo4j Sandbox is the perfect environment for experimenting with Neo4j.

You can log into Neo4j Sandbox and create a database with a number of pre-populated datasets by visiting https://sandbox.neo4j.com[sandbox.neo4j.com].


== Your Sandbox Credentials

[.credentials]
Browser URL:: https://{sandbox_host}:{sandbox_port}/
Bolt URI:: {sandbox_scheme}://{sandbox_host}:{sandbox_boltPort}
Username:: {sandbox_username}
Password:: {sandbox_password}

You can open a Neo4j Browser window throughout this course by clicking the **Toggle Sandbox** button in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.


=== Setting Environment Variables

You should add these files to your `.env` file so they can be used within the API.

..env File
[source,env,subs="attributes+"]
NEO4J_URI=bolt://{sandbox_ip}:{sandbox_boltPort}
NEO4J_USERNAME={sandbox-username}
NEO4J_PASSWORD={sandbox-password}

Once saved, these can be accessed through the `process.env` variable.

.Accessing Environment Variables
[source,js]
----
const {
  NEO4J_URI,
  NEO4J_USERNAME,
  NEO4J_PASSWORD,
} = process.env
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Applying Environment Variables
Remember to restart the process after saving the file to apply the environment variables.

We now have a project setup and running with dummy data, and we have added our sandbox configuration details to the environment variables.
We should now be ready to go.

In the next module, we will learn about the Neo4j JavaScript Driver.
