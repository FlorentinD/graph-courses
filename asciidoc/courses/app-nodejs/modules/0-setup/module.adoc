As part of this course, we will work on a link:https://github.com/{repo}[pre-built repository^] for the fictional client **Neoflix**.
The course is designed to be framework agnostic, so although we have chosen a specific set of frameworks, the tasks that you will perform will be the same regardless of your choice of framework.


== Objectives

At the end of this module, you will have learned how install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver dependency within the project, connect to your Neo4j Sandbox Account

* Clone the Neoflix example project and start the API
* Install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver
* Create an instance of the Driver
* Create a session, and run an example query
* Learn how to write to Neo4j by registering the User
* Learn how to read from Neo4j by implementing a Read Transaction

Throughout the course you will be asked to run one of a set of tests to verify that you have completed the steps.


== Repository Information

We have built a repository that takes care of the boiler plate, so you can focus on implementing the functionality.
