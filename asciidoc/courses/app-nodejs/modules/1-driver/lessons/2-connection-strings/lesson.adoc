= Connection Strings and Authentication
:type: quiz

In the previous lesson, you saw some example code for creating a new driver instance.
Let's take a closer look at the `driver()` method and how it is used to create a driver instance.

.Creating a Driver Instance

----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.js[tag=pseudo]
----

The `neo4j.driver()` function accepts the following arguments:

1. A connection string
2. An authentication token
3. Optionally, an object containing additional driver configuration

Let's take a look at these arguments in more detail.



== `1` The Connection String

The example in the previous lesson used the following connection string:

.Example Connection String
[source,role=nocopy]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.js[tag=connection]
----


A connection string typically consists of four elements.

1. The **scheme** used to connect to the Neo4j instance - for example `neo4j` or `neo4j+s` (required)
2. The server address for the Neo4j DBMS - for example `localhost` or `databaseid.databases.neo4j.io` (required)
3. The **port number** that the DBMS is running on (required if the instance is not running on the default port of `7687`)
4. Additional connection configuration (for example the routing context)


=== Choosing your Scheme

Most likely, you will use a variation of the `neo4j` scheme within your connection string.

* `neo4j` - Creates an **unencrypted** connection to the DBMS.  If you are connecting to a local DBMS or have not explicitly turned on encryption then this is most likely the option you are looking for.
* `neo4j+s` - Creates an **encrypted** connection to the DBMS.  The driver will verify the authenticity of the certificate and fail to verify connectivity if there is a problem with the certificate.
* `neo4j+ssc` - Creates an encrypted connection to the DBMS, but will not attempt to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

Variations of the `bolt` scheme can be used to connect directly to a single DBMS within a clustered environment.  This can be useful if you have a single server configured for data science or analytics.

* `bolt` - Creates an unencrypted connection directly to a single DBMS.
* `bolt+s` - Creates an encrypted connection directly to a single DBMS and verify the certificate.
* `bolt+ssc` - Creates an encrypted connection to directly to a single DBMS but will not attempt to verify the authenticity of the certificate.



[TIP]
.Which scheme string is right for you?
====
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your DBMS^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

If you are connecting to a DBMS hosted on Neo4j Aura, you will always use the `neo4j+s` scheme.
====

== `2` An Authentication Token

In most cases, you will connect to the DBMS using basic authentication consisting of a username and password.
You can create a basic authentication token by calling the `basic()` method on the `neo4j.auth` object.

.Creating a Basic Authentication Token
[source,js,role=nocopy,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/example/index.js[tag=auth]
----

// Neo4j also supports kerberos authentication tokens and can be extended to support custom authentication.
// These authentication methods require additional configuration and are outside of the scope of this course.

For more information on additional authentication methods, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and authorization^] section of the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/[Neo4j Operations Manual^].


== `3` Additional Driver Configuration (Optional)

The `driver()` method also accepts a third additional configuration object.
This object allows you to provide advanced configuration options, for example setting the connection pool size or changing timeout limits.

.Example Additional Configuration
[source,js,role=nocopy]
----
{
  maxConnectionPoolSize: 100,
  connectionTimeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  logging: {
    level: 'info',
    logger: (level, message) => console.log(level + ' ' + message)
  },
}
----

For more information or a full list of configuration options, please link:https://neo4j.com/docs/javascript-manual/current/get-started/[visit the Neo4j JavaScript Driver manual^].


== What happens next?

The driver will attempt to connect to the DBMS using the supplied credentials.
If everything is successful, the driver will then communicate with the DBMS and figure out the best way to execute each query.

You do not need to do any additional configuration when connecting to a single DBMS or a Neo4j cluster.
This means you do not have to adapt your application code, regardless of which environment you connect to.

Once the connection has been successfully made, your application can start to interact with the data in the graph.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to configure the driver.

In the next Challenge, you will add a Driver instance to the project.
