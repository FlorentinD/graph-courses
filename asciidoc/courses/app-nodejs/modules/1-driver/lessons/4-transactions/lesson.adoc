= Transactions in Detail
:order: 4

Neo4j uses an **ACID** consistency model to ensure that data is data is safely and consistently stored.
Many developers are familiar with ACID transactions from their work with relational databases, and as such the ACID consistency model has been the norm for some time.

The ACID acronym stands for:

* **Atomic** - All operations in a transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back.
* **Consistent** - On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound.
* **Isolated** - Transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated by the database so that transactions appear to run sequentially.
* **Durable** - The results of applying a transaction are permanent, even in the presence of failures.



There are three types of transaction exposed by the driver:
* Auto-commit Transactions
* Read Transactions
* Write Tranactions
