= Connecting to Neo4j
:order: 3

In the previous lesson, we saw an example connection string:

.Example Connection String
[source,role=nocopy]
----
  address of server
          ↓
neo4j://localhost:7687
  ↑                ↑
scheme        port number
----


Let's take a look at this connection string in more detail.

A connection string typically consists of four elements.

1. The **scheme** used to connect to the Neo4j instance - for example `neo4j` (required)
2. The server address for the Neo4j Service - for example `localhost` (required)
3. The **port number** that the Neo4j service is running on (required if not the default value of `7687`)
4. Additional connection configuration (for example the routing context)


== Choosing your Scheme

Most likely, you will use a variation of the `neo4j` scheme within your connection string.

* `neo4j` - Creates an **unencrypted** connection to Neo4j.  If you are connecting to a local Neo4j instance or have not explicitly turned on encryption then this is most likely the option you are looking for
* `neo4j+s` - Creates an **encrypted** connection to Neo4j.  The driver will verify the authenticity of the certificate and fail to verify connectivity if there is a problem with the certificate.
* `neo4j+ssc` - Creates an encrypted connection to Neo4j, but will not attempt to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

Variations of the `bolt` scheme can be used to connect directly to a single Neo4j instance.  This can be useful if you have a single server configured for data science or analytics.

* `bolt` - Creates an unencrypted connection directly to a single Neo4j instance.
* `bolt+s` - Creates an encrypted connection directly to a single Neo4j instance and verify the certificate.
* `bolt+ssc` - Creates an encrypted connection to directly to a single Neo4j instance but will not attempt to verify the authenticity of the certificate.



[TIP]
.Which scheme string is right for you?
====
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your server^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

If you are connecting to an instance hosted on Neo4j Aura, you will always use the `neo4j+s` scheme.

== What happens next?

The driver will attempt to connect to a Neo4j instance using the supplied credentials.
If everything is successful, the driver will then take use the server configuration details to work out whether to send the queries to a single instance or distribute the queries across the cluster.

This means that regardless of whether you are connecting to a single instance of Neo4j or a cluster of servers, your application code will remain the same.

Once the connection has been successfully made, we can start to interact with the data in the graph.
