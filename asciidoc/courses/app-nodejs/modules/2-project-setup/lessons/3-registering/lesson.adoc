= Registering a User
:order: 3

A key piece of functionality that we should provide is for new users to be able to register themselves with the site.  This functionality is already built into the front end, but at the moment the credentials are hard coded in the API.

In order to register a user, we will need to **write** some data to the Neo4j database.
To do this, we will use the `writeTransaction` function that we learned about in the link:../../1-driver/4-transactions[Sessions & Transactions Lesson^].
