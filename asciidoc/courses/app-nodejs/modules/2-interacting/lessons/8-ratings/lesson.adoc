= Rating Movies
:type: challenge

image::images/rating-form.png[Rating a Movie, role=right]
On every Movie page, the user is invited to rate a movie on scale of 1 to 5.
The form pictured to the right gives the user the ability to select a rating between 1 and 5 and click submit to save the rating.

When the form is submitted, the website sends an AJAX request to `/api/account/ratings/{movieId}` and the following will happen:


1. The server directs the request to the route handler in `src/routes/account.routes.js`, which verifies the user's JWT token before handling the request.
2. The route handler creates an instance of the `RatingService` in `src/services/favorites.service.js`.
3. The `add` method is called on the `RatingService`, accepting the ID of the current user, the ID of the movie and a rating (which should be a number).
4.  It is then the responsibility of the `RatingService` to save this information to the database.


== Saving a Rating

When we save a rating to the database, a `:RATED` relationship will be created between the `:User` and `:Movie` nodes.
The relationship will have a `rating` property which holds the value submitted by the user, which should be saved as an integer.

After the data is saved, the UI expects the movie details to be returned, with an additional property called `rating`, which will be the rating that the user has given for the movie.

As mentioned in the previous lesson, there is some work to do in order to convert this number to a value that can be stored as an integer in the Cypher type system.
If we do not do this, then the number will be stored as a `float`.


Let's take a look at the existing method in the `RatingService`.

.src/services/rating.service
[source,js]
----
async add(userId, movieId, rating) {
    // TODO: Convert the native integer into a Neo4j Integer
    // TODO: Save the rating in the database
    return Promise.resolve(goodfellas)
}
----

=== Converting the rating to a Neo4j Integer

To convert the native JavaScript integer to a Neo4j Integer, we can use the `int` function exported from `neo4j-driver`.

[source,js]
----
import { int } from 'neo4j-driver'

// ...

async add(userId, movieId, rating) {
    // Convert the native integer into a Neo4j Integer
    rating = int(rating)

    // ...
}
----

[TIP]
====
We could also use the `toInteger` function in Cypher to convert the value sent by the driver.

[source,cypher,rel=norun]
toInteger(20.0) // 20
====

Next, we will need to execute a Write Transaction, with a query to `MATCH` the User and Movie nodes, then `MERGE` a relationship between them with the `rating` property set.

[source,js]
----
import { int } from 'neo4j-driver'

// ...

async add(userId, movieId, rating) {
    // Convert the native integer into a Neo4j Integer
    const rating = int()

    // Save the rating in the database
    const session = this.driver.session()
    const res = await session.writeTransaction(tx => tx.run(`
        MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
        MATCH (m:Movie {tmdbId: $movieId})

        MERGE (u)-[r:RATED]->(m)
        SET r.rating = $rating

        RETURN m {
            .*,
            rating: r.rating
        } AS movie
    `, { userId, movieId, rating }))

    // Throw an error if the user or movie could not be found
    if ( res.records.length === 0 ) {
        throw new NotFoundError(`Couldn't create a rating for User ${userId} and Movie ${movieId}`)
    }

    // Get movie information
    const movie = res.records[0].get('movie')

    // Close the session
    await session.close()

    return movie
}
----

[TIP]
By using the `MERGE` keyword here, we will overwrite an existing rating if one already exists.
This way we don't need to worry about duplicates or deleting existing records.


=== But `rating` is an integer?!

If you have tested the method already, you would have seen that the `rating` property has been returned by the API as an Object with a high and low: `{ low: 5, high: 0 }`

By default, Express will do its best to interpret and return the value based on the properties of the `Integer` object.
We can try to convert this property back to an Integer in the front end, or better yet handle the conversion in our API.

We can use the `toNativeTypes` method function to convert the values within the object.

We can simply import the `toNativeTypes` method mentioned in link:../3-type-system/[The Cypher Type System lesson] and pass the `movie` variable to it as part of the `return` statement.

.Converting Neo4j Types back to JavaScript types
[source,js]
----
import { toNativeTypes } from '../utils.js'

// ...
return toNativeTypes(movie)

    // Save the rating in the database
    const session = this.driver.session()
    const res = await session.writeTransaction(tx => tx.run(`
        MATCH (u:User {userId: $userId})
        MATCH (m:Movie {tmdbId: $movieId})

        MERGE (u)-[r:RATED]->(m)
        SET r.rating = $rating

        RETURN m {
            .*,
            rating: r.rating
        } AS movie
    `, { userId, movieId, rating }))

    // Throw an error if the user or movie could not be found
    if ( res.records.length === 0 ) {
        throw new NotFoundError(`Couldn't create a rating for User ${userId} and Movie ${movieId}`)
    }

    // Return movie details and a rating
    const movie = res.records[0].get('movie')

    // Close the session
    await session.close()

    return toNativeTypes(movie)
}

== Testing

To test that the rating functionality has been correctly implemented, run the following command in a new terminal session:

[source,sh]
npm run test 06

If all tests pass then the rating functionality has been successfully implemented.

You can view the test file by opening `test/challenges/06-rating-movies.spec.js`.

== Lesson Summary

In this lesson we have learned how to convert a JavaScript type into a Neo4j integer and how to convert it back when returning the data through the API.

In the next lesson, we will look at managing the user's Favorites List.
