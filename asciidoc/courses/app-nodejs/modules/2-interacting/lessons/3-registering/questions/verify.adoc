== Verifying the Test

Here is where things get interesting.

If you have completed the course to this point, you should have a project that connects to the Neo4j Sandbox instance.

If the test above has succeeded, there should be a `:User` node in the sandbox with the email address `graphacademy@neo4j.com`, name `Graph Academy` and an encrypted password.


verify::[]

//appears when user clicks the Hint button
[TIP]
====
You can run the following query to check for the user within the database.
If the `shouldVerify` value returns true, the verification should be successful.

MATCH (u:User {email: 'graphacademy@neo4j.com'})
RETURN u.email, u.name, u.password,
    (u.email = 'graphacademy@neo4j.com' AND u.name = 'Graph Academy' AND u.password <> 'letmein') AS shouldVerify
