= 2. Reading from the Database

Say we want to create a new transaction that reads.  We want any queries from this method to be distributed across the cluster.

Use the dropdown in the code block below to select the correct method.

[source,java,rel=nocopy]
----
var res = session./*select:readMethod*/(tx -> {
    // Use tx.run to read from the database
})
----

- [ ] read
- [ ] readQuery
- [*] readTransaction
- [ ] writeTransaction
