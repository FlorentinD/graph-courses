= Setting up the Project
:type: text
:order: 1
// :java-version: 17.0.2

We have put together a project with all the boilerplate in place.
As you move through this course, you will learn some theory and then how to apply it to the example project.

In order to run the project, you must make sure that Java is installed.


== Setup Java

We are assuming that in taking this course, you already have at least a basic understanding of Java.

If you haven't already installed Java, you should install Java using link:https://sdkman.io[ sdkman^] with `sdk install java 17-open`.

The project has been written to work with Java version **{java-version}**.

You can verify that the installation is successful by running the following command in the command line:

.Verify Java Version
[source,sh]
java --version

You will also need a package manager to install the dependencies. Maven is not included with Java, but you can also install it with sdkman: `sdk install maven`.


== Clone the Repository

You can obtain a copy of the project source code by cloning link:https://github.com/{repository}[the {repository} repository^] from Github.
Or, if you prefer, you can also link:https://github.com/{repository}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[download a zip file with the source^].


//[.tab]
//.HTTPS
//====
//To clone the repository without logging in via HTTPS, you can run the following command to clone the repository:
//
//.Clone Repository Using HTTPS
//[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
//git clone https://github.com/{repository}.git
//
//====

[.tab]
.SSH
====

If you have a GitHub account configured with SSH access, you can run the following command to clone the repository:

.Clone Repository using SSH
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
git clone git@github.com:{repository}.git

====

//[.tab]
//.GitHub CLI
//====
//
//If you have the link:https://cli.github.com/[GitHub CLI^] installed, you can run the following command to clone the repository:
//
//.Clone Repository using the GitHub CLI
//[source,sh,subs="attributes+"]
//gh repo clone {repository}
//
//====

[.tab]
.Download Zip File
====

Click the following link to download the source as a .zip file.

https://github.com/{repository}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip.

====


== Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the folder in your terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies: `mvn verify`

.Install Dependencies using Maven
[source,sh]
mvn verify

You can view a full list of dependencies by opening link:{repository-raw}/main/pom.xml[`pom.xml`^].

[WARNING]
.Errors while installing dependencies?
====
This project has been written using Java version **{java-version}**.
If you are using the wrong version, you may experience errors when trying to install the dependencies.

If you experience any problems, run the following commands to set your Java configuration to the correct version for your current terminal session with `sdk use java 17-open`.

[source,sh]
----
mvn verify

====


== Setting Environment Variables

This project uses the built-in link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Properties.html[`java.util.Properties`^] class to manage environment variables for this project.
When the `load()` method exported by the `Properties` class is called, the `application.properties` file in the root of the project is parsed and all settings are accessible from an initialized `Properties` object.

The project contains an example file at `example.properties`.  You can run the following command in your terminal window to copy the example file to `application.properties`.

[source,sh]
cp example.properties application.properties


== Start the Project

To start the project, run the following command:

.Start the project using Maven
[source,sh]
mvn compile exec:java

You should see an output similar to the following confirming that the server has successfully started:

.Console Output
[source,role=nocopy]
Started server at port 3000

Unless you change the `APP_PORT` setting in `application.properties`, the server will listen on http://localhost:3000.
You can change which port the server listens on by editing the `APP_PORT` variable in `application.properties` and restarting the process.


== A Brief Tour of the Project

If you open up the listening address in your browser, you will see a Single Page Application (SPA) that communicates with the API served at http://localhost:3000/api.
Currently, the responses are hardcoded, but as you progress through the course, you will learn how to query Neo4j to find this information.

Here are some of the important directories in the project:

TODO

* `example/` - Example code for driver instantiation.
* `src/main/neoflix` - The application code:
** `middleware/` - Some custom middleware functions that are used by Express including generic error handling.
** `passport/` - Logic required for user authentication.
** `routes/` - Route handlers that are registered on the server.  You shouldn't need to edit these files.
** `services/` - Services that you will need to update to interact with Neo4j.
* `test/` - Test files that will you will need to run in order to pass the text.  You will run these using the `npm run test` or `yarn run test` command.
* `public/` - Minified build files for the SPA.  *Do not edit these files*.

== Next Steps

Now that we have the project up and running, let's take a look at the Neo4j Sandbox instance that has been created as part of your enrollment in this course.
