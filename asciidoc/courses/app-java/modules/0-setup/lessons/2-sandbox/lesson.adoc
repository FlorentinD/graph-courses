=== Setting Application Properties

You should add these properties to your `application.properties` file so they can be used within the API.

.application.properties File
[source,env,subs="attributes+"]
----
NEO4J_URI=neo4j://{sandbox_ip}:{sandbox_boltPort}
NEO4J_USERNAME={sandbox_username}
NEO4J_PASSWORD={sandbox_password}
----

Once saved, these can be accessed through the `application.properties` variable.
