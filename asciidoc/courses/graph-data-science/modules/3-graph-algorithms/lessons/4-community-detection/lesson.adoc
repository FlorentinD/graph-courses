== Introduction
Community detection algorithms are used to evaluate  how nodes may be clustered or partitioned in a graph. A graph is said to have _community structure_ if it's nodes easily group into (potentially overlapping) sets.  Most often this grouping is based on relationship structure, such that nodes in each set are much more densely connected to each other relative to other nodes outside the set. Much, but not all, of the community detection in GDS is focused on distinguishing and assigning Ids to these node sets for purposes of downstream analytics, visualization, or other processing.

Common use cases of community detection include:

* *Fraud detection*: Finding fraud rings by identifying accounts that transact frequently and suspiciously and/or share identifiers with one another.
* *Customer 360*: Disambiguating multiple records and interactions into a single customer profile so an organization has an aggregated source of truth for each customer.
* *Market segmentation*: dividing a target market into approachable subgroups based priorities, behaviors, interests, and other criteria.

=== Weakly Connected Components
The Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm finds sets of connected nodes in an undirected graph, where all nodes in the same set form a connected component. WCC is an effective tool for partitioning the graph into disjoint sets based on a one or multiple relationship types. In GDS, WCC scales well to very large graphs and is used frequently in fraud detection, entity resolution, customer 360, market segmentation, and multiple other use cases.

=== Louvain
A common community detection algorithm is Louvain. It maximizes a modularity score for each community, where the modularity quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities. This means evaluating how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.
