== Introduction
Similarity algorithms, as the name implies, are used to infer similarity between pairs of nodes.

Common use cases for similarity include:

* *Fraud detection:* finding potential fraud user accounts by analyzing how similar a set of new user accounts is to flagged accounts
* *Recommendation Systems:* In an online retail store, identify items that pair to the one currently being viewed by a user to inform impressions and increase rate of purchase
* *Entity Resolution*: Identify nodes that are similar to one another based on activbity otr identifying information in the graph

== Similarity Algorithms in GDS
GDS has two primary similarity algorithms:

* *Node Similarity*: Determines similarity between nodes based on the present and relative proportion of shared neighboring nodes in the graph. Node Similarity is a good choice where explainable is important, and you can narrow down the universe of comparisons to a subset of your data. Examples of narrowing down include focusing on just single communities, newly added nodes, or nodes within a specific proximity to a subgraph of interest.

* *K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN):* Determines similarity based off node properties.  The GDS KNN implementation scales well globally over large graphs when tuned appropriately. it can be used in conjunction with embeddings and other graph algorithms to determine the similarity between nodes based on proximity in the graph, node properties, community structure, importance/centrality, etc.
