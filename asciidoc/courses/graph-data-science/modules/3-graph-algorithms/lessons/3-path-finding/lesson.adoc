== Introduction
Path finding algorithms find the shortest path between two or more nodes or evaluate the availability and quality of paths.
Common use cases of pathfinding are:

* *Supply chain analytics*: Identifying the fastest path between an origin and a destination or between a raw material and a finished product
* *Customer Journey*: Analyzing the events that make up a customer's experience. In healthcare for example, this can be the experience of an in-patient from admission to discharge.

=== Dijkstra Source-Target
A common, industry standard, similarity algorithm is Dijkstra. It computes the shortest path between a source and a target node.

----
//confirm both actors are in the graph
MATCH(a:Actor)
WHERE a.name IN ['Kevin Bacon', 'Denzel Washington']
RETURN a.name, id(a)
----

----
// include to clean up if there is a previous 'proj' graph
CALL gds.graph.drop('proj');
//projection of persons acting and/or directing movies
CALL gds.graph.project('proj',
    ['Person','Movie'],
    {
        ACTED_IN:{orientation:'UNDIRECTED'},
        DIRECTED:{orientation:'UNDIRECTED'}
    }
);

//get the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and Denzel Washington
CALL gds.shortestPath.dijkstra.stream('proj', {sourceNode:14487, TargetNode:16395})
YIELD index, sourceNode, targetNode, path
RETURN index,
    gds.util.asNode(sourceNode).name AS sourceNodeName,
    gds.util.asNode(targetNode).name AS targetNodeName,
    nodes(path) as path
ORDER BY index;
