= Graph Management

== Module Overview

In this module we will provide a high-level technical overview of the Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library. This will serve as a foundation for upcoming modules that will go over graph, algorithm and machine learning usage in more detail.

In this module, we will cover three core areas:

* Product Overview - How GDS is packaged, how to install it and licensing considerations
* How GDS Works - Graph projection patterns, general workflow and design
* Configuration - Proper sizing and memory configurations and estimation
