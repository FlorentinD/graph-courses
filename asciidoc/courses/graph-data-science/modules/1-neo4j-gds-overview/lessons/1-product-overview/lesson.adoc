== Introduction
The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library is delivered as a plugin to the Neo4j Graph Database. The plugin needs to be installed into the database and added to the `allowlist` in the Neo4j configuration.


The compatibility matrix for The GDS library vs Neo4j can be found https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/supported-neo4j-versions/:[here]. In general, you can count on the latest version of GDS supporting the latest version of Neo4j and vice versa, and we recommend you always upgrade to that combination.

=== Installation

NOTE: This step is specific to those using on-prem installations.  GDS comes pre-installed on AuraDS and Data Science sandboxes
