Neo4j Data Importer Early Access is evolving rapidly.

There are two URLs for launching the **latest** version of Neo4j Data Importer:

* For connecting to a remote DBMS: https://data-importer.neo4j.io/?acceptTerms=true
* For connecting to local or remote DBMSs: https://data-importer.graphapp.io/?acceptTerms=true

In this course we use the neo4j.io Version 0.7.0 of Neo4j Data Importer since we use a Neo4j Sandbox instance for this course.

While the essence of the product remains the same, the UI may look different as the versions of the product evolve.
