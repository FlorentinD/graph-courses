== What is the Data Importer?

The Data Importer can be found here: http://data-importer.graphapp.io/

It is a graph app the allows you to load CSV files from your local system into the graph app, examine them, and map them to nodes and relationships in a Neo4j graph.
After you have defined the mapping, you connect to a running Neo4j DBMS to perform the import.
The benefit of the Data Importer is that you need not know Cypher to load the data.

It is useful for loading small to medium CSV files that contain fewer that 1M rows.

All data that is imported into the graph is interpreted as String data.
If you data model has properties that are not String, you will need to post-process the graph after the import.
You will learn about this later in this course.

=== Requirements for using the Data Importer

* You must use CSV files for import.
* CSV files must reside on your local system so you can load them into the graph app.
* CSV data must be clean (you learned this in an earlier lesson).
* IDs must be unique for all nodes you will be creating.
* The CSV file must have headers.

=== Steps for using the Data Importer

Before you do the import, you should have a starting idea of how your graph data model should be implemented.
The UI for the Data Importer uses the same UI elements that are used in the https://arrows.app/[Arrows tool^].


. Place the CSV file(s) on your local system and ensure they have headers and are clean.
. Open the Neo4j Data Importer tool: http://data-importer.graphapp.io/
. Load the CSV files on your local system into the graph app.
. Examine the CSV data to determine:
.. Files to be used to create nodes.
.. Files to be used to create relationships.
. Create the nodes:
.. Add the node in the UI.
.. Specify a label for the node
.. Define mapping details:
... Specify properties for the node (select from file).
... Rename properties (optional).
... Specify the unique ID  property for the node.
.. Confirm CSV file in the left panel is all set for import.
. Create the relationships:
.. Add the relationship in the UI.
.. Define the mapping details:
... Specify the type for the relationship.
... Specify the from and to unique property IDs to use.
... Add properties for the relationship (optional).
.. Confirm CSV in the left panel is all set for import.
. Perform the import
.. Specify connection URL and credentials
. View the import results
. View the imported data in Neo4j Browser

If you have de-normalized data, you will  need to perform a multi-pass import. That is you cannot create multiple node and relationship type from a single CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
Watch the video for this lesson. You will be doing the import yourself in the next Challenge.

=== Other features of the Neo4j Data Importer

You can import or export your mappings to a JSON file or to a ZIP file if you also want to include the CSV files.
