=== 1. `MERGE` behavior

Suppose you have created a uniqueness constraint for User nodes with this code:

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT User_userId ON (u:User) ASSERT u.userId IS UNIQUE
----

What happens when you execute this code?

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/ratings.csv'
AS row
MERGE (u:User {userId: row.userId})
ON CREATE SET u.name = row.name
----

* [ ] It creates a User node for every row in the CSV file, regardless of what is in the graph.
* [ ] It updates every existing User node in the graph with the value of row.userId.
* [ ] It only updates User nodes that have the value of row.userId.
* [x] It creates a User node for row.userId  with a property of name if userId is not found in the graph.

[TIP]
====
`MERGE` first does a `MATCH` before it processes the rest of the query.
Remember that there is a uniqueness constraint on the User.userId property.
