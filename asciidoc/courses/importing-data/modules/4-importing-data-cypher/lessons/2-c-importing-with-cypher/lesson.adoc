= Importing with Cypher
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

[WARNING]
This Challenge is a WIP. We still need to verify that the fully loaded db matches the recommendations sandbox db.

In this Challenge, you will add more data to the graph you have been working with.
You will use different CSV files that are much larger than what you have used previously.

[IMPORTANT]
Although you can execute the Cypher code in this challenge, you can only verify your results of this Challenge if you have not completed all previous Challenges.

This challenge has 7 steps:

. Import _Movie_  and _Genre_ data.
. Import _Person_ data.
. Import  the ACTED_IN relationships.
. Import  the DIRECTED relationships.
. Import _User_ data.

== Step 1: Import _Movie_  and _Genre_ data

As a first step, execute this code in the sandbox to the right so that you can ensure that the movie data is being property transformed from the CSV file:

[source,Cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
//process only Movie rows
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Movie"
RETURN
row.tmdbId,
row.imdbId,
toFloat(row.imdbRating),
row.released,
row.title,
toInteger(row.year),
row.poster,
toInteger(row.runtime),
split(coalesce(row.countries,""), "|"),
toInteger(row.imdbVotes),
toInteger(row.revenue),
row.plot,
row.url,
toInteger(row.budget),
split(coalesce(row.languages,""), "|"),
split(coalesce(row.genres,""), "|")
LIMIT 10
----

This is the Cypher code for first pass we will make through the 2-movieData.csv file to create the _Movie_, _Person_, and _Genre_ nodes.
Notice in this code we perform all of the necessary transformations of types when we set the properties for the _Movie_ node.
We use `MERGE` to only create the _Movie_ and _Genre_ nodes if they do not already exist.
And we create the _IN_GENRE_ relationships.

Execute this code in the sandbox to the right to read the CSV data and create the _Movie_ and _Genre_ nodes:

[source,Cypher]
----
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
//process only Movie rows
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Movie"
MERGE (m:Movie {movieId: row.movieId})
ON CREATE SET
m.tmdbId = row.tmdbId,
m.imdbId = row.imdbId,
m.imdbRating = toFloat(row.imdbRating),
m.released = row.released,
m.title = row.title,
m.year = toInteger(row.year),
m.poster = row.poster,
m.runtime = toInteger(row.runtime),
m.countries = split(coalesce(row.countries,""), "|"),
m.imdbVotes = toInteger(row.imdbVotes),
m.revenue = toInteger(row.revenue),
m.plot = row.plot,
m.url = row.url,
m.budget = toInteger(row.budget),
m.languages = split(coalesce(row.languages,""), "|")
WITH m,split(coalesce(row.genres,""), "|") AS genres
UNWIND genres AS genre
WITH m, genre
MERGE (g:Genre {name:genre})
MERGE (m)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g)
----

When you execute this code you should see:

Added 9035 labels, created 9035 nodes, set 135983 properties, created 20128 relationships

== Step 2: Import _Person_ data

As a first step, execute this code in the sandbox to the right so that you can ensure that the person data is being property transformed from the CSV file:

[source,Cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Person"
RETURN
row.tmdbId,
row.imdbId,
row.bornIn,
row.name,
row.bio,
row.poster,
row.url,
CASE row.born WHEN "" THEN null ELSE date(row.born) END,
CASE row.died WHEN "" THEN null ELSE date(row.died) END
LIMIT 10
----

This is the Cypher code for second pass we will make through the 2-movieData.csv file to create the _Person_ nodes for actors.
Notice in this code we perform all of the necessary transformations of types when we set the properties for the _Person_ node.
We use `MERGE` to only create the _Person_ nodes if they do not already exist. We also set the _Actor_ label and create the _ACTED_IN_ relationships and set the _role_ property for the relationship.

Execute this code in the sandbox on the right.

[source,Cypher]
----
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Person"
MERGE (p:Person {tmdbId: row.tmdbId})
ON CREATE SET
p.imdbId = row.imdbId,
p.bornIn = row.bornIn,
p.name = row.name,
p.bio = row.bio,
p.poster = row.poster,
p.url = row.url,
p.born = CASE row.born WHEN "" THEN null ELSE date(row.born) END,
p.died = CASE row.died WHEN "" THEN null ELSE date(row.died) END
----

When you execute this code, you should see:

Added 18603 labels, created 18603 nodes, set 116195 properties

== Step 3: Import  the ACTED_IN relationships

As a first step, execute this code in the sandbox to the right to see what data is being read from the CSV file:

[source,Cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Join" AND row.Work = "Acting"
RETURN
row.tmdbId,
row.movieId,
row.role
LIMIT 10
----

This is the Cypher code for third pass we will make through the 2-movieData.csv file to create ACTED_IN relationships in the graph.
We also add the _Actor_ label to the _Person_ node. Execute this code in the sandbox on the right.

[source,Cypher]
----
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Join" AND row.Work = "Acting"
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: row.tmdbId})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: row.movieId})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
ON CREATE
SET r.role = row.role
SET p:Actor
----

When you execute this code, you should see:

Added 15090 labels, set 33914 properties, created 35538 relationships

== Step 4: Import  the DIRECTED relationships

As a first step, execute this code in the sandbox to the right to see what data is being read from the CSV file:

[source,Cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Join" AND row.Work = "Directing"
RETURN
row.tmdbId,
row.movieId,
row.role
LIMIT 10
----

There are some rows in the CSV file where a value of "Directing" _Work_ could have an associated role value.
Modify the above query to show such rows.

*Hint:* Add `AND exists(row.role)` to the `WHERE` clause.


This is the Cypher code for forth pass we will make through the 2-movieData.csv file to create DIRECTED relationships in the graph.
We also add the _Director_ label to the _Person_ node. Execute this code in the sandbox on the right.

[source,Cypher]
----
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-movieData.csv'
AS row
WITH row WHERE row.Entity = "Join" AND row.Work = "Directing"
MATCH (p:Person {tmdbId: row.tmdbId})
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: row.movieId})
MERGE (p)-[r:DIRECTED]->(m)
ON CREATE
SET r.role = row.role
SET p:Director
----

When you execute this code, you should see:

Added 3994 labels, set 1140 properties, created 9908 relationship

== Step 5: Import the _User_ data

The *2-ratingData.csv* file contains data for users who rated movies.

As a first step, execute this code in the sandbox to the right to see what data is being read from the CSV file:

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-ratingData.csv'
AS row
RETURN
row.movieId,
row.userId,
row.name,
toInteger(row.rating),
toInteger(row.timestamp)
LIMIT 100
----


Here is the code to create the users and _RATED_ relationships.

Execute this code in the sandbox on the right.

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
FROM 'https://data.neo4j.com/importing/2-ratingData.csv'
AS row
MATCH (m:Movie {movieId: row.movieId})
MERGE (u:User {userId: row.userId})
ON CREATE SET u.name = row.name
MERGE (u)-[r:RATED]->(m)
ON CREATE SET r.rating = toInteger(row.rating),
r.timestamp = toInteger(row.timestamp)
----

When you execute this code, you should see:

Added 111 labels, created 111 nodes, set 193042 properties, created 96410 relationships
