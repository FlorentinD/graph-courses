=== 1. Delimiting fields in CSV files

Suppose your CSV file uses the ";" character to separate the fields in the file.
What Cypher keyword to you use to tell `LOAD CSV` to use this delimiter?

* [ ] `WITH SEMI-COLON`
* [ ] `USE SEMI-COLON`
* [x] `FIELDTERMINATOR`
* [ ] ";" is the default so you need not specify anything additional in you `LOAD CSV` clause.

[TIP]
====
There is only one default delimiter accepted by `LOAD CSV`.
