= Creating Constraints
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

Before we load data into the graph, we want to make sure that all constraints have been created in the graph.
In this challenge, you will create uniqueness constraints in the graph for:

* Movie: movieId
* Movie: tmdbId
* Person: tmdbId
* User: userId
* Genre: name

[start=1]
. Use the sandbox window to the right to add the first constraint, Movie_movieId.
. Then, modify the code to create each of the remaining constraints (4 of them).
. You can confirm your constraints with [copy]#CALL db.constraints#.

[TIP]
--
Name each constraint <label>_<property>_.

== Summary

In this challenge, you created the constraints to enforce uniqueness of the Movie, Person, User, and Genere nodes you will be creating when you load the data into the graph.

In the next module, you load data into the graph.
