== What does importing data mean?

When you import data into Neo4j, you typically have a set of source files that were produced from an RDBMS.
The data is saved in these source files of types CSV, JSON, XML, etc.
Cypher has a clause for loading data from CSV files.
The APOC library has procedures for loading data from many more file types that include CSV, JSON, XML, XLS, HTML, and GraphML.
The data in the source files may contain more data than what you need in your graph or they may include everything you need.
In addition, the data in the source files may represent data types that are not supported in Neo4j.
Some data in the source files may need to be transformed into types that are supported by Neo4j.

The types of data that you can store as properties in Neo4j include:

* String
* Integer
* Float (decimal)
* Boolean
* Date/Datetime
* Spatial
* List (comma-separated list of numbers, strings)

After you understand the source data you have to work with and you also know the graph data model you will be implementing, you can import the data into Neo4j with Cypher code.
The import involves reading the source data and using it to create nodes, relationships, and properties in the graph.

== Importing CSV data

CSV is a common file type that can be extracted from an RDBMS.
You work with application stakeholders to define the graph data model that will be implemented with the source data.
You then use the graph data model to write Cypher code to perform the import.
Cypher has a `LOAD CSV` clause to read CSV data as rows and use the rows to create nodes and relationships in the graph.

Using Cypher and `LOAD CSV` is a common way to import data into Neo4j.
To perform this type of import, the Neo4j DBMS must be started.
With this type of import, the Cypher statement to load the data is a transaction.

In this course, you will not be creating the source data files for import, but you will be using files that have already been created for you.

== Steps for preparing for importing data

Here are the steps you follow to prepare for importing data into Neo4j:

. Understand the data in the source data files.
. Create or understand the graph data model.
. Clean the data in the source data files.
. Identify if data needs to be transformed from the source data files before it is written to the graph.
. Create the uniqueness constraints in the database.

The first type of source data files you will be working with in this course are CSV files.
The steps that you use for preparing to import CSV data are similar to the steps you use for importing other data file types.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned what importing data into Neo4j means and the steps you must take before you import data into Neo4j.
In the next lesson, you will learn how CSV source data may be organized.
