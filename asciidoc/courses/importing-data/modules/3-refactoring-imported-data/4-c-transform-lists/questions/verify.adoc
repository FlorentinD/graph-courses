[TIP]
====
To transform the lists:

MATCH (m:Movie)
SET m.countries = split(coalesce(m.countries,""), "|"),
m.languages = split(coalesce(m.languages,""), "|"),
m.genres = split(coalesce(m.genres,""), "|")

If your graph does not verify, you will need to go back to the previous 2 Challenges to import the data and and transform to types Long, Double, Date, and StringArray again.
