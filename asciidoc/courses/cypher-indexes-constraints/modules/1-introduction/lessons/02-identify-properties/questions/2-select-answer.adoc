= 2. When to create indexes and constraints?

Suppose you are starting with an empty graph and you need to load millions of nodes and relationships into the graph.
What is the best practice for when to create indexes and constraints in your graph? (select all that apply)

* [ ] Create all constraints and indexes before you load the data into the graph.
* [ ] Create all constraints and indexes after you load the eata into the graph.
* [x] Create the constraints before you load the data into the graph.
* [x] Create the indexes after you load the data into the graph.

.Hint
====
You want some checking of data  and fast lookups during the loading of the data to prevent duplication of data.
Write performance is diminished when indexes need to be maintained.

.Solution
====
The correct answers are:

* Create the constraints before you load the data into the graph.
* Create the indexes after you load the data into the graph.
