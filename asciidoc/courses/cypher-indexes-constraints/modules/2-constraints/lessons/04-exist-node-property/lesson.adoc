== Existence constraints for nodes

Depending on your application needs, you may want to ensure that particular nodes always have a particular property.
For example, a Person node **must** have a property, name.
The name need not be unique for all Person nodes, but the application does not permit a Person node without a name property.

== Syntax for creating an existence constraint on a node

Here is the syntax for creating an existence constraint on a node property:

[source,cypher,rel="norun nocopy"]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> IF NOT EXISTS ON (x:<node_label>) ASSERT x.<property_key> IS UNIQUE
----

You specify the name of the constraint, the node label it will be associated with, and the name of the property.

* If a constraint already exists in the graph with the same name, no constraint is created.
* If a constraint does not exist in the graph with the same name:
** No constraint is created if there already is a uniqueness constraint for that node label and property key.
** Otherwise, the constraint is created.

=== Creating a uniqueness constraint

Earlier in this course, we identified the movieId property as a unique value for every movie in our graph.
Execute this code to create a uniqueness constraint for this property:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT Movie_movieId_uniqueness IF NOT EXISTS ON (x:Movie) ASSERT x.movieId IS UNIQUE
----

This code creates the uniqueness constraint named Movie_movieId_uniqueness. It is always a best practice to name constraints.

[NOTE]
You typically create constraints before the data is loaded into the graph, but in our case, we already have the data in the graph.

=== Listing constraints in the graph

You can view the existing constraints in the graph as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
SHOW CONSTRAINTS
----

=== Uniqueness in node creation

Now that you have created the uniqueness constraint, we will see it in action.

In our graph, we already have a Movie with the movieId of "1".
Try to execute this code to create a Movie node with the same value for movieId:

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {movieId: '1'})
----

This code does not modify the graph. It first finds the Movie node with this value for movieId and because the node already exists, does not create the node.

=== Uniqueness constraint creation failure

Suppose we have already loaded our data into the graph and we want to create a uniqueness constraint.
In the previous example, our data is clean and we know that the Movie.movieId values in the graph are unique.
Because the values are unique, the creation of the constraint was successful.

What if we are unsure if the property values for a node are unique?
If we attempt to create a uniqueness constraint on a property that is not unique for all nodes with that label, the constraint creation will fail.

Execute this code that attempts to create a uniqueness constraint on the Movie.year property:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT Movie_year_uniqueness IF NOT EXISTS ON (x:Movie) ASSERT x.year IS UNIQUE
----

This code will fail because the values for the year property are not unique across all Movie nodes.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a uniqueness constraint.
In the next challenge, you will create more uniqueness constraints.
