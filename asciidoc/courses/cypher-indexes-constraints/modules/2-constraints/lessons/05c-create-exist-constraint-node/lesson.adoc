= Creating Existence Constraints for Node properties
:type: challenge
:sandbox: true

== Property must exist

In our Movie data model, we want to ensure every Movie in the graph has a value for its title property.
In your real application, you would create existence constraints for nodes prior to loading the data.
For this course, we already have the data loaded, but we still want to constrain the graph so that all Movies have titles.

In the previous lesson, you executed code to create an existence constraint for the Person nodes to ensure they always have a value for the name property.
In this Challenge, you will create three more uniqueness constraints in the graph.

In the sandbox on the right, modify the code to create these existence constraints in the graph:

1. For the Person nodes:

* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#User_name_existence#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#User#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#name#

2. For the Movie nodes:

* *`constraint_name`*: [copy]#Movie_title_existence#
* *`node_label`*: [copy]#Movie#
* *`property_key`*: [copy]#title#

After you have created the constraints, list them:

SHOW CONSTRAINTS

[NOTE]
--
If you create incorrect constraints with different names or property_key names, do not worry.
You can create new ones, provided the constraint_name or property_key is unique.
Later in this course you will learn how to remove constraints from the graph.

If you need it, this code will remove **all** indexes and constraints from the graph:

`CALL apoc.schema.assert({},{},true)`

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create existentence constraints for node properties in the graph.
In the next lesson, you will learn how to create existence constraints for relationship properties.
