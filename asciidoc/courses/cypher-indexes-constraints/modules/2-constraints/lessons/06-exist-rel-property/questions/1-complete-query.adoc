= 1. Creating an existence constraint on a relationship property

Suppose we have a graph that contains Company and Person nodes.
Some Person nodes have the relationship, `:WORKS_AT` a Company node.

We want to ensure that the `:WORKS_AT` relationships in the graph always have a property with key, `.since`.
Before we load the Company data, we want to create an existence constraint for `:WORKS_AT` relationships we will be creating.

What is the correct statement to create this constraint?


* [x] `CREATE CONSTRAINT WORKS_AT_since_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR ()-[x:WORKS_AT]-() REQUIRE x.since IS NOT NULL`
* [ ] `CREATE EXISTENCE CONSTRAINT WORKS_AT_since_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (WORKS_AT.since)`
* [ ] `CREATE EXISTENCE CONSTRAINT WORKS_AT_since_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR ()-[x:WORKS_AT]-() WITH (x.since)`
* [ ] `CREATE CONSTRAINT WORKS_AT_since_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR ()-[x:WORKS_AT]-() EXISTS x.since`

.Hint
====
You specify the type of constraint at the end of the statement.
You must specify a path that contains the relationship type.
