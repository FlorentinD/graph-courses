= Using Constraints in Neo4j
:sandbox: true
:order: 2

//[.transcript]
== Module overview

You make your queries and loading data more performant when you create indexes and constraints in the graph,

In this module, you will:

* Learn about the types of indexes and constraints available in Neo4j and why you would use them.
* Learn what properties in the graph will benefit from an index or constraint,

== Data model for this course

This course uses the movie recommendations dataset as a starting point for your learning.

This is the same dataset that will be used for the application development courses in GraphAcademy.

Here is the graph data model:

The node labels for the graph include:

* Person
* Actor
* Director
* Movie
* Genre
* User

The relationships for the graph include:

* ACTED_IN (with an  optional role property)
* DIRECTED (with an optional role property)
* RATED (with rating  and timestamp properties)
* IN_GENRE

Also notice that the nodes have a number of properties, along with the type of data that will be used for each property.

Each node with a given label has a property that uniquely identifies the node.
You will be creating uniqueness constraints for these properties in the graph.

* Movie nodes use  _movieId_.
* Person nodes use _tmdbId_.
* User nodes use _userId_.
* Genre nodes use _name_.
