= 1. Creating a TEXT index

Suppose we have a graph that contains Company nodes. One of the properties of a Company node is name.
We want to be able to optimize queries that test whether the Company name contains a string.
What is the correct statement to create this TEXT index?


* [ ] `CREATE TEXT-INDEX Company_name_text IF NOT EXISTS ON (Company.name)`
* [x] `CREATE TEXT INDEX Company_name_text IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) ON (x.name)`
* [ ] `CREATE TEXT_INDEX Company_name_text IF NOT EXISTS FOR (x:Company) ON (x.name)`
* [ ] `CREATE TEXT INDEX Company_name_text IF NOT EXISTS ON (Company.name)`
