= Using Indexes in Neo4j
:sandbox: false
:order: 3

//[.transcript]
== Module overview

Indexes are used to provide faster Cypher queries.
You have already learned that uniqueness constraints enable you to quickly look up a node.
A uniqueness constraint is implemented as a specialized type of index.
You can also use indexes to make queries faster, even when multiple nodes or relationships have the same property value.

In this module, you will:

* Learn about the types indexes available in Neo4j and why you would use them.
* Create an index on a node property.
* Create a uniqueness constraint for a set of properties.
* Create a composite index on a set of node properties.
* Create a node label LOOKUP index.
* Create a relationship type LOOKUP index.
* Create a TEXT index.
* Manage indexes in the graph.
