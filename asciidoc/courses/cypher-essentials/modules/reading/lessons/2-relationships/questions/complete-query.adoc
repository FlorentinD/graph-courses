=== Reversing the relationship direction

Say we wrote our query above differently and started with the `:Movie` node.
Use the dropdown below to traverse the relationship in an incoming direction.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
----

[TIP]
Remember that relationships can be traversed in either direction.

* [ ] `-[:ACTED_IN]->`
* [x] `<-[:ACTED_IN]-`
