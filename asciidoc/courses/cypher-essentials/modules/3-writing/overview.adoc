= Writing Data to Neo4j
:order: 3


In this module we will explore how to update the graph using Cypher and the Movies example dataset.

Watch this video to learn how Cypher is used to retrieve nodes and relationships in the graph by traversing patterns the graph.

First, you will use the `CREATE` statement to create nodes or relationships in the graph.
You can set the properties for a node or relationship inline or with the `SET` keyword.
Another way that you can create nodes and relationships is with the `MERGE` statement. The `MERGE` statement allows you to check if a node or relationship exists before it is created. If the node or relationship exists, you can update it.
And finally, you will learn how to delete nodes and relationships in the graph.

== Domain model for this course

Again, here is the domain model and how it is represented in our graph:
