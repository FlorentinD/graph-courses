= Challenge: Updating Properties
:order: 6
:usecase: movies
:sandbox: true
:verify: MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'}) WHERE  m.tagline = 'Gripping, scary, witty and timely!' AND m.released = 2017 RETURN true AS outcome

We discovered that we created the _Movie_ node for the movie [copy]#Get Out#, but we forgot to add the tagline which is [copy]#Gripping, scary, witty and timely!# and the released year of 2017.

Write the Cypher code to find this _Movie_ node and add the _tagline_ and _released_ properties for the node.
