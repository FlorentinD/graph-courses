= Challenge: Merge Processing
:order: 8
:usecase: movies
:sandbox: true
:verify: MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Rocketman'}) WHERE  m.revenue > 0 RETURN true AS outcome

We do not know if we have the movie [copy]#Rocketman# in our graph.
Write the Cypher code to create it, if it does not exist and set the released property to 2019 and set a new property named revenue with a value of 1000.
If the movie already exists, update the revenue to be 10 times the existing revenue.

Write the Cypher code to use `MERGE` to create or update this _Movie_ node.
