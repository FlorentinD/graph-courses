=== 1. `MERGE` processing

Suppose we have no _Person_ or _Movie_ nodes in our graph. What does this Cypher code do?

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Lucille Ball'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'Forever, Darling'})
----


* [ ] It creates one relationship and no nodes.
* [ ] It creates two nodes and no relationship.
* [x] It creates two nodes and one relationship.
* [ ] It does not modify the graph.

[TIP]
====
This statement will try to find the _Person_ nodes.
Since this graph has no _Person_ nodes, it will create them.
It will complete the pattern.
