= Challenge: Creating a Relationship
:order: 4
:usecase: movies
:sandbox: true
:verify: MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Daniel Kaluuya'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'}) RETURN true AS outcome

We want to make another addition to the graph.

Use the sandbox window to the right to:

. Find the _Person_ node for  [copy]#Daniel Kaluuya#.
. Create the movie, [copy]#Get Out#.
. Add the _ACTED_IN_ relationship between Daniel and the movie.

[TIP]
--
Remember that our other _Movie_ nodes contain a property called _title_.
