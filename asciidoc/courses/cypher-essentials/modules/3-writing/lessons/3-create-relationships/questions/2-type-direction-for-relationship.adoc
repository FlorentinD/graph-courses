=== 2. Using `MERGE` for relationships

 When using `MERGE` to create a relationship, what must you specify?

* [ ] The number of nodes the relationship will connect.
* [x] The type for the relationship.
* [x] The direction of the relationship.
* [x] the references to the two nodes that will be connected.

[TIP]
====
You can only create relationships between existing nodes.
When you draw the property graph model on the whiteboard, you always specify these two characteristics of a relationship.
