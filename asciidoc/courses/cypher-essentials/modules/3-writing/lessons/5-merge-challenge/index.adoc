= Challenge: Merging Data
:order: 5
:usecase: movies
:sandbox: true
:verify: MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Jack Epps Jr'})-[:WROTE]->(m:Movie {title: 'Top Gun'}) RETURN true AS outcome

We discovered that we missed a writer for the movie, _Top Gun_.  Suppose we do not know if we have a person named _Jack Epps Jr._ in our database.
Write the Cypher code using MERGE to
add _Jack Epps Jr._ as a writer for the movie _Top Gun_.

//browser::MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Jack Epps Jr'})[]

[TIP]
We know that the movie _Top Gun_ exists in the database.
Use MATCH to find the _Movie_ node and then use `MERGE` to create the _Person_ and then use `MERGE` to create the relationship.
