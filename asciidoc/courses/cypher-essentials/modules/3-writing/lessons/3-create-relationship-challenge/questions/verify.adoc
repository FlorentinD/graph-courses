Once you have run the query, click the **Check Database** button and we will check the database for you.

[TIP]
====
To find the match the pattern in the database, we would run the following Cypher query:

MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Daniel Kaluuya'
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
MATCH (p)-[:ACTED_IN {roles: ['Chris Washington']}]->(m)
RETURN p, m

**Hint:** All you need to do is change the first keyword in the second and third lines to create the movie and relationship.
