= Challenge: Creating a Relationship
:order: 3
:usecase: movies
:sandbox: true
:verify: MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Daniel Kaluuya'})-[:ACTED_IN {roles: ['Chris Washington']}]->(m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'}) RETURN true AS outcome

We want to make another addition to the graph.

Use the sandbox window to the right to:

. Find the _Person_ node for  _Daniel Kaluuya_.
. Add the movie, Get Out.
. Add the _ACTED_IN_ relationship between Daniel and the movie where his role was _Chris Washington_.

[TIP]
--
Remember that our other Movie nodes contain a property called _title_.

The other _ACTED_IN_ relationships in the graph have a property, _roles_.
