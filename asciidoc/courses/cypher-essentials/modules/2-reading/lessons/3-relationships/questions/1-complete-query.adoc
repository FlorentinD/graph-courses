=== 1. Specifying the relationship direction

Say we wrote our query above differently and started with the _Movie_ node.
Use the dropdown below to select the correct direction for the query.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher],role=nocopy norun
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
----

[TIP]
Remember that relationships can be traversed in either direction.

* [ ] `+-[:ACTED_IN]->+`
* [x] `+<-[:ACTED_IN]-+`
