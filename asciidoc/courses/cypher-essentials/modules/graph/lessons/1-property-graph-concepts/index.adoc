Important Neo4j concepts used in Cypher are:

* nodes
** node labels
* relationships
** relationship types
** relationship direction
* properties
** property keys
** property values


The nodes and relationships form the structure and patterns in the graph.

== Domain Model

Here is the model you will be working with in this course.
The nodes in the graph are labeled Person and Movie. There are many relationship types between Person nodes and Movie nodes.
Some Person nodes also have the FOLLOWS relationship to other Person nodes.

== Understanding what is in the graph

If you have an existing graph, before you begin working with it, you should understand the data model which includes:

* Node labels
* Relationship types
* Relationship directions
* Property keys

The domain model show above was visualized in Neo4j Browser using this Cypher code.

[TIP]
Try hitting the **Run Query** button to see the results.

Run this Cypher code:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

This visualization shows the Node labels, the relationships in the graph, and the direction of the relationships between the nodes

In addition, you can retrieve the property keys used in the graph.

Run this Cypher code:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.propertyKeys()
----

[NOTE]

This list of keys does not tell you which properties are used in nodes or relationships.
