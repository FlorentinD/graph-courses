= Creating Data
:order: 1

We use the `CREATE` keyword to create a _pattern_ in the database.

After the `CREATE` keyword, we specify the pattern that we want to create.
Usually this will be a single node or a relationship between two nodes.

For example, if we wanted to create a node to represent **Tom Hanks** we can run the following query:

[source,cypher]
CREATE (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})

// browser::MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)[]

== Multiple Statements
We can also chain multiple `CREATE` statements together within a single cypher query.

[source,cypher]
CREATE (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})
CREATE (m:Movie {name: "Forrest Gump"})
CREATE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)


== Mix and Match
These `CREATE` statements can be combined with other statements.
For example, if the Person and Movie nodes both already exist, we can find them using a `MATCH` statement before creating the relationship between them:

[source,cypher]
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})
MATCH (m:Movie {name: "Forrest Gump"})
CREATE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)

It is good practise to use the `MATCH` clause up front to find any nodes in the database before running any write operations.

== Setting Properties within a `CREATE` statement

There are two ways that you can set a property within a `CREATE` statement.

=== 1. Within the pattern

As in the queries above, we have set the `name` property for the `:Person` node within the pattern.
We can do the same thing when creating a relationship by specifing the properties within braces (`{` and `}`).

[source,cypher]
// ...
CREATE (p)-[:ACTED_IN {roles: ['Forrest']}]->(m)

In this block, we have set the roles property on the relationship to an array of values - containing one value, `Forrest`.


=== 2. Using the `SET` keyword

We also have the option to use the `SET` keyword.
In the context of a CREATE statement, these two do exactly the same thing.
But knowing about the `SET` clause now will help us in the upcoming lessons.

[source,cypher]
// ...
CREATE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m)
SET r.roles = ['Forrest']


== Check your understanding

[.question]
=== What keyword would we use to create a node or relationship?

* [ ] `INSERT`
* [x] `CREATE`

[.question]
=== How can we set properties against a relationship within a `CREATE` statement?

* [x] Within the pattern inside the `CREATE` relationship
* [x] By assigning a variable to the relationship and using the `SET` clause

[TIP]
Both statements are valid
