=== Restricting the data returned

Say our graph contained `:Actor` nodes that acted in both movies and TV Shows - how could we ensure that we only return movies from our query?

* [*] Add the `:Movie` label to the relevent node in the `MATCH` clause
* [*] Add a WHERE clause where we specify that `m` must have a `:Movie` label
* [ ] Just hope that we get the right results
* [ ] Filter it out in the application layer
