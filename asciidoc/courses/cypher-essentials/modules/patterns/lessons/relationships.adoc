In the previous lesson, we used the `MATCH` clause to find the node in our database that represented Tom Hanks.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})
----

We can extend the pattern in the match clause to _traverse_ through all relationships with a type of `ACTED_IN` to any node.
Our domain model shows that the `:ACTED_IN` relationship goes in an outgoing direction from the Person so we can add the.

We often refer to this as a _traversal_.


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->()
----

Our data model dictates that the node at the other end of that relationship will be `:Movie` node, so we don't necessarily need to specify the `:Movie` label in the node - instead we will assign the variable `m`

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
----

If we had multiple _types_ of node at the end of the relationship, we could make sure that we only return .


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
----

=== Reversing the relationship direction
Say we wrote our query above differently and started with the `:Movie` node.
Use the dropdown below to traverse the relationship in an incoming direction.

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)/*select:<-[:ACTED_IN]-*/(p:Person)
RETURN m.title, p.name
----

[TIP]
Remember that relationships can be traversed in either direction.

* [ ] `-[:ACTED_IN]->`
* [x] `<-[:ACTED_IN]-`


[.question]
=== Restricting the data returned

Say our graph contained `:Actor` nodes that acted in both movies and TV Shows - how could we ensure that we only return movies from our query?

* [*] Add the `:Movie` label to the relevent node in the `MATCH` clause
* [*] Add a WHERE clause where we specify that `m` must have a `:Movie` label
* [ ] Just hope that we get the right results
* [ ] Filter it out in the application layer
