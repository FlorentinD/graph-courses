== What is Cypher?
Cypher is a query language designed for graphs.

The whiteboard model is stored in the database as a graph.

When we draw a graph on paper or the whiteboard, we represent it as circles connected together using arrows.

`[WHITEBOARD SHOT]`

Just as we would draw circles and arrows on a piece of paper, we draw out the pattern

* Nodes are represented by brackets `()`
* We use a colon to signify the label(s) `(:Person)`
* Relationships between nodes are drawn with two dashes `(:Person)--(:Movie)`
* The direction is indicated using a greater than or less than symbol `<` or `>`
* Information about the relationship are drawn in a square box using the square brackets between the two dashes: `[` and `]`
* Properties are drawn in a _speech bubble_ in a JSON like syntax.
  * Properties in Neo4j are key/value pairs

== How Cypher works
Cypher works by matching patterns in the data.
We do this using the `MATCH` keyword.
You can think of the `MATCH` keyword as similar to the `FROM` clause in an SQL statement.

For example, if we want to find a Person in the graph, we would `MATCH` and pattern of a single node with a label of `:Person` - prefixed with a colon (`:`)

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person)
----

Because we want to use this node later on in the query we can assign a variable by placing a value before the colon.
Let's use the variable `p`

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
----

Now, say we want to find the node which represents **Tom Hanks**.
Our `:Person` nodes all have a name property.
We can use the __braces__ to draw this speech bubble, adding the key/value pair of `name` and `Tom Hanks`.
As `Tom Hanks` is a string, we will need to place it inside speech marks (single or doubel are both fine).

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})
----


Now that we have our basic pattern, we would use the `RETURN` keyword to specify the information we want to return in the query.
We can access properties using a _dot notation_, for example to find the `name` property we would use `p.name`.

[TIP]
Try hitting the **Run Query** button to see the results.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})
RETURN p.name
----

// | p.name |
// | -- |
// | Tom Hanks |
