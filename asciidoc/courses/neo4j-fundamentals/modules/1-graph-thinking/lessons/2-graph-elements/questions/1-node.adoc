=== 1. Nodes or relationships?

Say we wanted to add additional data to our graph to detail that Michael lives in London, which element would best represent that location?

* [x] Node
* [ ] Relationship

[TIP]
====
We would use nodes to represent a location, and use a relationship to represent the connection between Michael and London.
