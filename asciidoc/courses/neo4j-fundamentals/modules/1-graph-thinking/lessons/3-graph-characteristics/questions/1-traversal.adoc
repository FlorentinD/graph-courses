Given this graph:

Suppose we have this graph where a relationship can be traversed multiple times. How many unique paths are traversed to go from Springfield to Centerville?

* [ ] 1
* [ ] 2
* [x] 3
* [ ] 4

[TIP]
====
The starting node is Springfield and the ending node is Centerville. We can traverse a relationship multiple times, but the paths must begin with Springfield and end with Centerville.
