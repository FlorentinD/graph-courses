A graph database is a database management system with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations working on a graph data model.

Graph databases are often used as part of an Enterprise online transaction processing (OLTP) system.
Accordingly, they are normally optimized for transactional performance, and engineered with transactional integrity and operational availability in mind.

Unlike other databases, relationships take first priority in graph databases.
This means your application doesn't have to infer data connections using foreign keys or out-of-band processing, such as MapReduce.
By assembling the simple abstractions of nodes and relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable you to build sophisticated models that map closely to your problem domain.
Data scientists can use the relationships in a data model to help enterprises make important business decisions.

== Neo4j is a native graph database

Neo4j implements the relationships in the graph as pointers making graph traversal very fast.

== Querying using Cypher is intuitive

If you have ever tried to write a SQL statement with a large number of JOINs, you know that you quickly lose sight of what the query actually does, due to the number of tables that are required to connect the data.

Example: Here is an SQL statement for listing the employees in the IT Department:

[source,SQL,role=nocopy noplay]
----
SELECT name FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Person_Department
  ON Person.Id = Person_Department.PersonId
LEFT JOIN Department
  ON Department.Id = Person_Department.DepartmentId
WHERE Department.name = "IT Department"
----

Example: Here is a Cypher statement to do the same. It is clean and focused since queries are expressed visually:

[source,Cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)<-[:EMPLOYEE]-(d:Department)
WHERE d.name = "IT Department"
RETURN p.name
----

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned that Neo4j is a native graph database and provides optimal performance for queries based upon relationships between the data in the graph.
