== The Movie database

Throughout the courses of GraphAcademy, you will use some version of the Movie database to gain experience with Neo4j.

=== Nodes

The nodes in the Movie database represents people, movies, and in some versions of the Movie database, genres for the movies.

The most basic version of the Movie database contains:

* 38 Movie nodes (nodes with the label Movie)
* 133 Person nodes (nodes with the label Person)

==== Node properties

All _Movie_ nodes have a property, _title_ that is used to uniquely identify a node.
This property exists for all _Movie_ nodes.

Other properties that a _Movie_ node may have are:

* _released_, the year that the movie was released
* _tagline_, a phrase to describe the movie.

=== Relationships

As you have learned, the most important element of a graph database is its relationships.
A relationship has a type and a direction and represents the relationship between two nodes.

Some of the relationships in the Movie graph include:

* _ACTED_IN_: Used to represent that a particular person acted in a particular movie. (172)
* _DIRECTED_: Used to represent that a particular person directed a particular movie. (44)
* _WROTE_: Used to represent that a particular person wrote a particular movie. (10)
* _PRODUCED_: Used to represent that a particular person produced a particular movie. (15)

A person can have multiple relationships to a movie. For example, a person can be both an actor and a director for a particular movie.
The numbers to the right of each relationship type are the number of each type of relationship in the graph.
In the Movie graph, people are either actors, directors, writers or producers given these relationships.

Other relationships in the graph include:

* _REVIEWED_: Used to represent that a particular person reviewed a particular movie. (9)
* _FOLLOWS_: Used to represent that a particular person follows another particular person. (3)

Using these relationships, people are can be reviewers, followers, or followees.
In the Movie graph, people who review movies or follow other people are not actors, directors, writers, or producers
