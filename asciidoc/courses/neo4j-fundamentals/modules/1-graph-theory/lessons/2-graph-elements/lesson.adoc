= Graph Elements
:order: 2

Let's take a closer look at the two elements that make up a graph:

* Nodes (AKA. Vertices)
* Relationships (AKA. Edges)

== Nodes

*Nodes* are the circles in a graph.
These commonly represent _objects_, _entities_ or merely _things_.

In the link:../1-seven-bridges/[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg^] example in the previous lesson, nodes were used to represent the land masses.

Another example that everyone can relate to is the concept of a Social Graph.
People interact with each other and form relationships of varying strengths.

The diagram to the right has two nodes which represent two people, **Michael** and **Sarah**.
On their own, these elements are uninspiring.
But when we start to connect these circles together, things start to get interesting.

.Nodes typically represent _things_
[TIP]
Examples of entities that could typically be represented as a node are: person, product, event, book or subway station.


== Relationships

*Relationships* (or _Edges_) are used to connect nodes.
We can use relationships to
// add context to the graph.
embed facts into our Graph.

If we take the previous example, we can use the graph to state that **Michael** is _married to_ **Sarah**.
All of a sudden, we know that we are looking at some sort of _social_ graph.

We can use this graph to demonstrate many facts about Michael and Sarah.
For example, let's say that Michael _lives_ in **London**, and _works for_ a company called **RI**.



Now, let's introduce a third person, **Hans**, to our Graph.

image::images/michael-knows-hans.jpg[Three nodes representing Michael, Sarah and Hans, role=right]
**Hans** also _works for_ **RI** along with Michael.
Depending on the size of the company and the properties of the relationship, we may be able to infer that Michael and Hans know each other.

If that is the case, how likely is it that Sarah and Hans know eachother?
These are all questions that can be answered using a graph.

.Relationships are typically nouns
[TIP]
 We could use a relationship to represent a personal or professional connection (_knows_, _married to_), to state a fact (_Person *lives in* location_, _Person *owns* Car_, _Person *rated* Movie_) or even to represent a hierarchy (_Parent *parnt of* Child_, _Software *depends on* Library).

Examples of entities that could typically be represented as a node are: person, product, event, book or subway station.
