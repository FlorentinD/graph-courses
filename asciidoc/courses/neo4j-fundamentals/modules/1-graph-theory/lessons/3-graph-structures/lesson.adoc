There are a few types of graph to consider.

== Directed vs Undirected Graphs

In an undirected graph, relationships are considered to be bidirectional.
An example of an undirected graph would include the concept of marriage.  If _Person A_ is married to _Person B_ then it stands to reason that _Person B_ is also married to _Person A_.

A directed graph add an additional dimension of information to the graph.
Relationships with the same type but in opposing directions carry different semantic meaning.
Directional relationships can often be qualified with a some sort of weighting.

If marriage is a symmetrical relationship, then the concept of love is asymmetrical.
Although two people may like or love eachother, the amount that they do so may vary drastically.

== Weighted vs Unweighted Graphs

The concept of love is also an example of a weighted graph.  In a weighted graph, the relationships between nodes carry a value to that represent a variety of measures, for example cost, time, distance or priority.

A basic shortest path algorithm would calculate the shortest distance between two nodes in the graph.  This could be useful for finding the fastest walking route to the local store or working out the most efficient route to travel from city to city.

However, more complex shortest path algorithms (for example, Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search algorith) take a weighting property on the relationship into account when calculating the shortest path.  Say we have to send a package using an international courier, we may prefer to send the package by air so it arrives quickly, in which case the weighting we would take into account is the time to take to get from one point to the next.

Inversely, if cost is an issue we may prefer to send the package by sea and therefore use a property that represents cost to weight the results.
