= Graphs Are Everywhere
:order: 4

As we discovered previously, the fundamental structure of a graph has applications far beyond mathematics.
In fact, you may have seen the phrase *Graphs are Everywhere* across the link:https://neo4j.com[neo4j.com] website.
It is our hope that you will start to see the connections between things everywhere.

Here are a few commonly used use cases for Neo4j.

== E-commerce and Real-Time Recommendations

Many online stores are traditionally built and run on relational databases.
But by adding a Graph Database either as a primary data store or as an additional data store, we can start to serve real time recommendations.

The first area that can be improved in e-commerce is the category hierarchy.  To find products in a parent and subsequent child categories can be difficult in a traditional SQL query, or require the duplication of data.  Conversely, this can be represented in a couple of lines of Cypher.

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
MATCH (c:Category)-[:HAS_CHILD|HAS_PRODUCT*1..3]->(p:Product)
RETURN p.id, p.title, collect(c.name) AS categories

You may also be familiar with the *People who bought _{Product A}_ also bought...* sections on your favourite online store.  These types of recommendations can be computationally expensive to generate due to the large amount of data that needs to be held in memory.  This creates the need for bath processes to be deployed in order to generate the recommendations.

Where graph databases have the edge in this category, is that a much smaller proportion of the graph needs to be compared in order to generate the recommendation.  You can simply traverse from one Product node, through the users who have purchased that product and onwards to the subsequent products that they have bought.
