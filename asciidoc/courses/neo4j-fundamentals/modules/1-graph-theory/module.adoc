== Module Overview

In the first lesson of this module, you will learn about Leonhard Euler, the Swiss mathematician who founded the study of graph theory.
Then you will learn about the elements that make up a graph and how they are used to solve real world problems.
Next, you will learn about common structures graphs.
Finally, you will learn about some common use-cases for graphs.

If you are ready, let's get going!
