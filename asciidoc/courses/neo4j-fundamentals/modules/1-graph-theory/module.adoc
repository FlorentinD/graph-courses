== Module Overview

In the first lesson of this module, we will introduce you to Leonhard Euler, the Swiss mathematician who founded the study of graph theory.

Then, we will look at how the principles first articulated by Euler are applied to this day to solve real world problems.

Finally, we will look at the elements that make up a graph and how they are used.

If you are ready, let's get going!
