== Module Overview

In this module, we take a deeper dive into Neo4j itself and break down the elements of a *labelled property graph*.
We will take a look at the index-free adjacency that gives native graph databases their edge when it comes to querying data.
We will also look at how we translate common elements of relational and NoSQL databases into Neo4j.
