== Module Overview

In this module, we take a deeper dive in to Neo4j itself and breakdown the elements of a *labelled property graph*.

We will take a look at the Index-free adjacency that gives native graph databases their edge when it comes to querying data and how we translate common elements of Relational and NoSQL databases into Neo4j.
