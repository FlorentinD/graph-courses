= Native Graph Advantage
:order: 2

Neo4j is a Native graph database, meaning that everything from the storage of the data to the query language have been designed specifically with traversal in mind.

Where native Graph databases stand apart from other databases is the concept of **Index-free Adjacency**.  When a database transaction is committed, a reference to the relationship is stored with the nodes at both the start and end of the relationship.  As each node is aware of every incoming and outgoing relationship connected to it, the underlying query engine will simply chase pointers in memory - something that computers are exceptionally good at.
