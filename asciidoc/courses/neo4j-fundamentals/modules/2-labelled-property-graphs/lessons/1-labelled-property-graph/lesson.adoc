= What is a Labelled Property Graph?
:order: 1

In the previous module we referred to Nodes and Relationships as the fundamental building blocks.  In this lesson we will go over the additional elements that make a *Labelled Property Graph*.


== Nodes, Labels and Properties

We have already discussed Nodes as the element that represents the _things_ in our data.
We can use two additional elements to provide some extra context to the data.

Let's take a look at how we can use these additional properties to improve our social graph.

=== Labels

By adding a label to a node, we are signifying that the node belongs to a subset of nodes within the graph.  Labels are important in Neo4j because they provide a starting point for the any cypher query.

Let's take **Michael** and **Sarah** - in this context both of these nodes are *People*.

We can embellish the graph by adding more labels to these nodes; Michael identifies as *Male* and Sarah is *Female*.
In this context, Michael is an *Employee* of a company, where as we don't have any information about Sarah's employment status.

Michael works for a *Company* called **RI**, so we can add that label to the node that represents RI.

[TIP]
In Neo4j, a node can have zero, one or more labels.


=== Properties

So far we're assuming that the nodes that represent Michael, Sarah and RI.
We can make this concrete by adding properties to the node.

These properties are key, value pairs and can be added or removed from a node as necessary.
Properties values can be a single value or list of values link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/values/[that conform to the Cypher type system^].

By adding `firstName` and `lastName` properties, we can see that the Michael node refers to *Michael Faraday*, known for Faraday's law of induction, the Faraday cage and lesser known as the inventor of the Party Balloon.
Michael was born on 22 September 1791.

Sarah's full name is Sarah Faraday, and her `maidenName` as Barnard.

By looking at the `name` property on the RI node, we can see that it refers to the *Royal Institute*.

[TIP]
Properties do not need to exists for each node with a particular label.
If a property does not exist against a node, it is treated as a `null` value.


== Relationships, Directions and Types

=== Relationship Directions

In Neo4j, each relationship must have a direction.  Although this direction is required, the relationship can be queried in either direction, or ignored completely at query time.

If we consider the concept of Directed & Undirected graphs that we discussed in the previous module, the direction of the `MARRIED_TO` relationship must exist and may provide some additional context but can be ignored for the purpose of the query.

The direction of a relationship can be important when it comes to hierarchy, although whether the relationships point up or down towards the tree is an arbitrary decision.


=== Relationship Types

Each relationship in a neo4j graph will have a type.
This allows us to choose at query time which proprotion of the graph we traverse.

For example, we can traverse through _every_ relationship from Michael, or we can specify the `MARRIED_TO` relationship to end up only at Sarah's node.


=== Properties

As with nodes, relationships can also have properties.  These can refer to a cost or distance in a weighted graph or just provide additional context to a relationship.

In our graph, we can place a property on the `MARRIED_TO` relationship to hold the date in which Michael and Sarah were married.  Both `WORKS_AT` relationships may have a `roles` property to signify any roles that the employee has filled at the company.
