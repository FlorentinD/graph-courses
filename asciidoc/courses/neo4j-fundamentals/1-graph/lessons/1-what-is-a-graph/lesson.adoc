== What is a graph?

A *graph* is set of discrete objects, each of which has some set of relationships with the other objects.

Graphs are a useful way to model data for the purposes of mathematical analysis, and they have been around for quite a long time.
The first use of graphs was by Leonhard Euler in 1735; he used graph theory to prove that the famous *Seven Bridges of Konigsberg* problem had no solution.

Konigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is a city spanning the Pregel River.
It includes two large islands, which are connected to one another and to the river banks by seven bridges.
A map of this arrangement is pictured here.

The Seven Bridges problem is this: Is there any possible route through the city that crosses every bridge exactly once?
Some pen-and-paper experimentation will quickly suggest that there is no such route.
However, PROVING that there is no solution is much more difficult; Euler invented Graph Theory as a tool to aid this proof.
The graph representation of the problem is on the right:  four land masses, each represented by a node, and seven bridges, each represented by a relationship.

Euler observed the following:

[square]
* The route taken within each landmass is irrelevant.  Only the sequence of bridges crossed matters.
* Whenever you enter a land mass via a bridge, you must leave it by a different bridge.
** ...except at the start (where you leave but do not enter) and at the end (where you enter but do not leave).
*Thus, for the problem to be solvable, every land mass (except the start and end) must be touched by an even number of bridges.

Based on the above observations, the problem has no solution, because all four of the land masses are touched by an odd number of bridges.

== Anything can be a graph

If graphs are an abstract mathematical tool, why do we care about them?

We care because any dataset can be represented as a graph.
Any structure or concept, no matter how simple or complex, can be broken down into a set constituent parts that have some relationship to one another.

For example, the Internet can be modeled as a network of computers.

At the other extreme of complexity, a single molecule can be represented as a graph of its constituent atoms--or an atom represented as a graph of subatomic particles.

And, as Euler showed, there are some clear benefits to representing data in this way.
We will discuss many of these as we go.
But mainly, graphs are uniquely useful when answering a question that  involves following a path along a chain of related items.

You will frequently hear Neo4j people refer to such questions as graph problems--and they are surprisingly common in the real world.
