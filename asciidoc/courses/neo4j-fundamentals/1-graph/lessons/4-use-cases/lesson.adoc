== Use cases for graph databases

The biggest value that graphs bring to an application is their ability to store relationships and connections as first-class entities.

For instance, the early adopters of graph technology built their businesses around the value of data relationships.
These companies have now become industry leaders: LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, and PayPal.

There are many uses for graph databases in an enterprise.
Here are some of them:

== Exploring graphgists

When you first learn how to use Cypher, you will use the very simple Movies graph data model.
If, however, you are curious about how other folks have created graph data models for Neo4j, you can explore the https://neo4j.com/graphgists/[graphgists page].

Graphgists are developed by a wide range of developers from Neo4j and from the Neo4j user community.
You can explore this site to see how other applications have modeled their data and get an appreciation for what can be done in Neo4j.

A graphgist:

* Describes the graph data model.
* Provides sample queries that you can run against an instance of the graph.
* Provides source code to create the graph yourself.

=== Example graphgist

For example, here is the _Bank Fraud Detection_ graphgist that has a description of the model, how to load the sample data, and how to query the data.

As you gain experience with Cypher and think about modeling your application, check out some of these graphgists for ideas for how to model your data.
