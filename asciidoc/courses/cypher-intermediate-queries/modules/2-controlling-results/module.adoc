:order: 2

//[.transcript]
== Module Overview

Thus far, you have seen that you can return nodes/relationships in Neo4j Browser or you can return properties.
In both cases, the results returned are rows of data.

In this module, you will learn how to:

* Order results returned.
* Limit the number of results returned.
* Add properties to returned nodes.
* Conditionally test results before returning them.
