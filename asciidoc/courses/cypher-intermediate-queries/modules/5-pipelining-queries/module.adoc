= Pipelining Queries


//[.transcript]
== Module Overview

You have learned much thus far about many of the Cypher clauses you can use to query the graph.
In this module, you will learn how to use the Cypher `WITH` clause to set values and control query processing.

In this module, you will learn how to use `WITH` to:

* Initialize data for a `MATCH` clause.
* Define and name a subset of data for a query.
* Limit data that is processed.
* Pass data from one part of a query to the next part of the query (pipelining).
* Unwind a temporary list for processing in a later part of a query.
