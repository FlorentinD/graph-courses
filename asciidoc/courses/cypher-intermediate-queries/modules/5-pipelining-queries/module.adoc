= Pipelining Queries


[.transcript]
== Module Overview

You have learned much thus far about many of the Cypher clauses you can use to query the graph.
Cypher has a `WITH` clause that enables you to use a value or set of values for a query.
There are many techniques you can use to `WITH` to define queries that generate intermediate results that are passed on to another part of the query.

In this module, you will learn how to use `WITH` to:

* Initialize data for a `MATCH` clause.
* Define and name a subset of data for a query.
* Limit data that is processed.
* Pass data from one part of a query to the next part of the query (pipelining).
* Unwind a temporary list for processing in a later part of a query.
