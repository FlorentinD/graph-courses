= 1. Scoping variables

Here is a query to return the name of the actor (Clint Eastwood) and all the movies that he acted in that contain the string 'high'.
How do you complete this query so it can return the desired results?

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
WITH  'Clint Eastwood' AS a, 'high' AS t
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
/*select:WITH   p, m, toLower(m.title) AS movieTitle*/
WHERE p.name = a
AND movieTitle CONTAINS t
RETURN p.name AS actor, m.title AS movie
----


* [ ] `WITH   toLower(m.title) AS movieTitle`
* [ ] `WITH   p, toLower(m.title) AS movieTitle`
* [ ] `WITH   m, toLower(m.title) AS movieTitle`
* [x] `WITH   p, m, toLower(m.title) AS movieTitle`

.Hint
====
The `WITH` clause removes variables from scope for the `RETURN` clause so you must add them back to the scope.

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is: `WITH   p, m, toLower(m.title) AS movieTitle`. movieTitle is created during the query and is passed down for use in the `WHERE` clause. In order to use the variables p and m, they must also be included.

If you do not include both p and m in the `WITH` clause (which re-scopes variables) these variables cannot be used later in the query and in the `RETURN` clause.
