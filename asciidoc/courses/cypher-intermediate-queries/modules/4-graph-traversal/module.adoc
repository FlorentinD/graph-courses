= Graph Traversal


//[.transcript]
== Module Overview

You have learned how to write queries that use multiple `MATCH` clauses as well as multiple patterns.
You have also learned that you can use `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` to gain more insight into the steps that occur during a query.

In this module, you will learn:

* How the graph engine traverses the graph during a query.
* How traversal works for variable-length patterns.
