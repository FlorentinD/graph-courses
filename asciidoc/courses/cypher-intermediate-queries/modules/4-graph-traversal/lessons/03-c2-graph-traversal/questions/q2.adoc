[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Robert Blake'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
MATCH (allActors:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
RETURN m.title, collect(allActors.name)
----

How many relationships are traversed to return the result?

.Hint
====
The query finds each movie that Robert Blake acted in. How many ACTED_IN traversals is that?

For each movie, it usss a second `MATCH` to find all actors to acted in that movie.
Because there are two `MATCH` clauses, it traverses the ACTED_IN relationship from Robert Blake twice.
