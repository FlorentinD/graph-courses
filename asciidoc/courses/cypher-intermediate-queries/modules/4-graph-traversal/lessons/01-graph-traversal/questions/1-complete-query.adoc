[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is: `MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[:RATED]-(reviewer)`  will perform the best because it uses a label for the anchor node, Movie and specifies the relationship type.

You need not specify a label for non-anchor nodes in the pattern.

Specifying the relationship type in a pattern will always yield better performance.
