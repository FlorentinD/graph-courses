* [ ] `MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*6]-(others:Person)`
* [ ] `MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*1,6]-(others:Person)`
* [ ] `MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN:1-6]-(others:Person)`

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*1..6]-(others:Person)` which returns Person nodes that are up to 6 hops away.

`MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*6]-(others:Person)` returns all Person nodes that are exactly 6 hops away.

The other choices are not valid Cypher.
