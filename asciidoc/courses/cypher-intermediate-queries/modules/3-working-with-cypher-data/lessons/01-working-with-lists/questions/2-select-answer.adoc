[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
`size(movies)` is the correct answer.

`size(collect(movies))` is incorrect because movies is already a list so you do not need to create another list.

`count()` is used to count the number of rows or variables returned, but is not used to return the number of elements in a list.
