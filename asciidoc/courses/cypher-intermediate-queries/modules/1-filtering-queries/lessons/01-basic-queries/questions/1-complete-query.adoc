= 1. Directors with a role

We want to find all people who directed a movie in 2015 where the `role` property exists on the relationship.  What code do you use?

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
/*select:WHERE r.role IS NOT NULL*/
AND m.year = 2015
RETURN p.name, r.role, m.title
----


* [ ] `WHERE p.role IS NOT NULL`
* [ ] `WHERE p.role = ?`
* [x] `WHERE r.role IS NOT NULL`
* [ ] `WHERE r.role = ?`

[TIP]
====
If a property does not exist on a node or relationship, it will be treated as a null value.

You can check for non-null values using the `IS NOT NULL` predicate.
