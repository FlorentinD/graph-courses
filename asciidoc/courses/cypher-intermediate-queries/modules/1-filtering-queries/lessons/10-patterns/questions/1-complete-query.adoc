How would you complete this query?

Once you have selected your option, click the **Check Results** query button to continue.

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE  p.name = "Clint Eastwood"
/*select:AND exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}*/
RETURN  m.title
----


* [x] `AND exists { (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m) }`
* [ ] `AND NOT exists { (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m) }`
* [ ] `AND p:Director`
* [ ] `AND p:Director AND p:Actor`

[TIP,role=hint]
.Hint
====
Does the DIRECTED relationship exist between the Clint Eastwood node and the Movie node?

[TIP,role=solution]
.Solution
====
The correct answer is: `AND exists { (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m) }`.
We need to check if the relationship exists so `NOT exists` is incorrect.

Performing the test of the label Director or Director and Actor is not sufficient because we are focussing on movies that Clint Eastwood both acted in and directed.
