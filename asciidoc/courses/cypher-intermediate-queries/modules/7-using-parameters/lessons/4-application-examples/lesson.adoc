== Application code that uses parameters

This lesson is intended to give you a very brief view of how a few of the programming languages that Neo4j supports uses Cypher with parameters.
Every programming language has its own protocol for providing parameters to  Cypher queries.
Note that the code in this lesson is not runnable on its own.

== Example: JavaScript

Here is a code snippet that illustrates the use of parameters in JavaScript:

[source,js]
----
const res = await session.readTransaction(tx =>
    tx.run(`
        MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
        WHERE m.title = $title
        RETURN p
        LIMIT 10
    `,
    { title: 'Toy Story'})
)
----

Here we see that the query is run as a read transaction and the title is parameterized.

== Example: Python

Here is a code snippet that illustrates the use of parameters in Python:

[source,python]
----
def get_actors(tx, movie): # (1)
    result = tx.run("""
        MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
        WHERE m.title = $title
        RETURN p
    """, title=movie)

    # Access the `p` value from each record
    return [ record["p"] for record in result ]
----
