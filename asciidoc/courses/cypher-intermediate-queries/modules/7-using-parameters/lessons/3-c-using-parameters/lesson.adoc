== Using parameters

Modify this query so that it utilizes the parameters you set in the previous challenge:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH "Tom"
AND "UK" IN m.countries
RETURN p.name as Actor, m.title as Title
----

After you have modified the query with parameters, answer this question:

include::./questions/q1.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::./questions/q2.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
