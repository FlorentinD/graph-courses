= Setting Parameters
:type: challenge

== Setting parameters

You want to parameterize this query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH "Tom"
AND "UK" IN m.countries
RETURN p.name as Actor, m.title as Title
----

We do not want to use hard-coded strings in our query, but rather parameters.

Write and execute the Neo4j Browser session command to set the Sub and Country parameters to "Tom" and "UK" respectively.

== Summary

In this challenge, you set values that will be used as parameters for a query.

In the next challenge, you will rewrite a query to use the parameters you just set.
