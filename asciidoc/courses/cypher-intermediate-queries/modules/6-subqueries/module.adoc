= Subqueries in Cypher


[.transcript]
== Module Overview

In Cypher, by default, a query represents a single transaction against the graph.
Large queries will use more memory and you may need to reduce the amount of memory required for a query.
Cypher query tuning is beyond the scope of this course, but in this lesson, you will learn some techniques for keeping queries smaller.
Of course, limiting results and filtering is the first easy way that you have already learned about.

In this module, you will learn how to:

* Use `CALL` to perform a subquery.
* Use `UNION` to combine the results of multiple queries
