= 2. Combining results

Here is a query that returns actor information for the year 2015:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE m.year = 2015
RETURN "Actor" AS Type,  p.name AS `Worked as`, collect(m.title) AS Movies
----

Execute this query to see what it returns.

Now add another query to this code to return the directors for 2015.
Use `UNION ALL` to combine results.

How many rows are returned in the result?

input::answer[]

* [x] 819

[HINT]
--
The second query will return the string "Director" as Type.
