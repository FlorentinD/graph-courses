== Avoid semantically orthogonal labels

You should be careful not to use the same type of label in different contexts.
For example, using the region for all types of nodes is not useful for most queries.

Here is an example:

image::images/orthogonal-labels.png[Orthogonal labels,width=400,align=center]

=== Avoid class hierarchies

You also want to avoid labeling your nodes to represent hierarchies.

You should not do this:

image::images/actor-hierarchy.png[Hierarchy of labels,width=400,align=center]

Instead, you should do this:

image::images/membership-instead-of-hierarchy.png[Membership instead,width=400,align=center]

In this lesson, you learned some ways of using labels that you should avoid in your model.
In the next module, you learn about refactoring to eliminate duplicate data.
