=== 3. Profiling queries

Suppose you want to see performance improvement if you change this query to use the _Actor_ label, rather than the _Person_ label.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.born STARTS WITH '195'
RETURN  p.name as `Born in the 50's`
----


Profile this query that uses the _Person_ label.

How many rows are retrieved in the first step of the profile?

input::answer[]

* [x] 5

Change the _Person_ label to an _Actor_ label and profile it.

How many rows are retrieved in the first step of the profile?

input::answer[]

* [x] 4


[TIP]
====
Prepend `PROFILE` to profile a query.
Use the Planning view to see the steps and the rows retrieved.
