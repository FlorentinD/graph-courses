== Why refactor?

Refactoring is the process of changing the data model *and* the graph.

There are three reasons why you would refactor:

. The graph as modeled does not answer all of the use cases.
. A new use cases has come up that you must account for in your data model.
. The Cypher for the use cases does not perform optimally (especially with the graph scales) and could benefit from a change in the data model.

=== Steps for refactoring

To refactor a graph data model and a graph, you must:

. Design the new data model.
. Write Cypher code to transform the existing graph to implement the new data model.
. Retest all use cases.
