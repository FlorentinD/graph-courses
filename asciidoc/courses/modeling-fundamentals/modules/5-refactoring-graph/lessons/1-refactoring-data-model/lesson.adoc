== Why refactor?

Refactoring is the process of changing the data model *and* the graph.

There are three reasons why you would refactor:

. The graph as modeled does not answer all of the domain questions.
. A new domain question has come up that you must account for in your data model.
. The Cypher for the domain questions does not perform optimally and could benefit from a change in the data model.

For the remainder of this course, we will focus on the third scenario so that you can learn some modeling best practices.

=== Steps for refactoring

To refactor a graph data model and a graph, you must:

. Design the new data model.
. Write Cypher code to transform the existing graph to implement the new data model.
. Retest all domain questions.

In this lesson, you learned why you refactor a graph and the steps for refactoring.
In the next lesson, you will learn a common type of refactoring that many developers implement.
