.Hint
====
Make sure you use `MERGE` to create the  _Role_ nodes and relationships, and you delete the _role_ property from the _ACTED_IN_ relationship.

Here is the solution code:

MATCH (a:Actor)-[r:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
MERGE (x:Role {name: r.role})
MERGE (a)-[:PLAYED]->(x)
MERGE (x)-[:IN_MOVIE]->(m)
SET r.role = null
