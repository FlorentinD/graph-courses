== Understanding the domain for your application

Before you begin the data modeling process you must:

* Identify the stakeholders and  developers of the application.
* With the stakeholders and developers:
** Describe the application in detail.
** Identify the users of the application (people, systems).
** Agree upon the use cases (questions) for the application.

[NOTE]
No knowledge of the underlying implementation is required!

=== Movie domain

In the course, _Neo4j Fundamentals_, you were introduced to the "starter" movie graph used for GraphAcademy training courses.
The domain that you will practice your graph data modeling skills is the movie industry domain as it is understood by most people.

The domain includes movies and people.
What makes this domain interesting are the connections or relationships between nodes in the graph and how the graph can be used to answer questions about the domain.

=== Use cases

Most use cases for an application can be enumerated by a comprehensive list of questions.
The questions help to define what the application will do at runtime.

Here are some of the domain questions we will be working with to develop the initial graph data model:

. What people acted in a movie?
. What person directed a movie?
. What movies did a person act in?
. How many users rated a movie?

In our domain, we want to differentiate a person who acted in or directed a movie and a user who rated a movie.
We have much more information about people such as their birth date, their tmdbID etc.
Users who rated movies will just be named or identified.

=== Identifying the entities of the domain

Entities are the nouns in your application questions:

. What *ingredients* are used in a *recipe*?
. Who is married to this *person*?

The entities of your use cases or questions will be the labeled nodes in the graph data model.

Given our movie domain questions, here are some of the labeled nodes that we will start with.

These labeled nodes will support these questions:

. What *people* acted in a *movie*?
. What *person* directed a *movie*?
. What *movies* did a *person* act in?

== Style guidelines for your graph data modeling

As you begin the graph data modeling process, it is important that you agree upon how node labels, relationship types, and property keys are named.
A Neo4j best practice is to use the following when you name the elements of the graph, but you are free to use any convention.

* A node label is a single identifier that begins with a capital letter (for example, Person, Movie).
* A relationship type is a single identifier that is in all capital letters with the underscore character (for example, FOLLOWS, MARRIED_TO).
* A property key for a node or a relationship is a single identifier that begins with a lower-case letter and can be camelCase (for example, tagLine, firstName).

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned that a good starting point for your data modeling is to come up with a set of questions for the use cases and identify the entities from the questions.
In the next challenge, you will further develop the model by adding another labeled node to the model.
