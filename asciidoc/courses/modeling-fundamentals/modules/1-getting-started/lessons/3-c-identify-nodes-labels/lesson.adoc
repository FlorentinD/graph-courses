Now for a challenge.

We have already identified the _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes for our domain questions:

. What [underline]#people# acted in a [underline]#movie#?
. What [underline]#person# directed a [underline]#movie#?
. What [underline]#movies# did a [underline]#person# act in?

We have an additional question that we must model for:

include::questions/verify.adoc[]

[.summary]
== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills to retrieve a node from the graph.
In the next lesson, you will learn how to traverse patterns in the graph with your queries.
