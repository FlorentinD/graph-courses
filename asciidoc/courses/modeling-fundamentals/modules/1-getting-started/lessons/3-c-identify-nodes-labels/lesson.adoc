:order: 3
:type: challenge

Now for a challenge.

We have already identified the _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes for our domain questions:

. What *people* acted in a *movie*?
. What *person* directed a *movie*?
. What *movies* did a *person* act in?

We have an additional question that we must model for.

As you go through this course, you can use any technique you want to for drawing out the graph data model.
Most people just use pen and paper.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills in identifying the entities of the domain and defining a node label for the graph data model.
In the next lesson, you will learn the differences between a graph data model and an instance model.
