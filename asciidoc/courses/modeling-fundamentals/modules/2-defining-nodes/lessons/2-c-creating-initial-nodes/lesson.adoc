Run this Cypher code to add the Person and Movie nodes to the graph which will serve as our initial instance model:

[TIP]
Click the *Run in Sandbox* button to the top right of the code sample to open the Sandbox to the right and run the query.

== Summary

In this challenge, you populated the graph with nodes to represent the initial instance model you will be working with in this course.

In the next challenge, you will model a new node for the graph data model.
