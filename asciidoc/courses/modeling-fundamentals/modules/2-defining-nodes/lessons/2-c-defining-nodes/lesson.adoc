= Identifying a New Label
:order: 2
:type: challenge


Now for a challenge.

We have already identified the _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes for our use cases:

. What *people* acted in a *movie*?
. What *person* directed a *movie*?
. What *movies* did a *person* act in?

We have an additional use case that we must model for.

*Note*: As you go through this course, you can use any technique you want to for drawing out the graph data model.
Most people just use pen and paper.

In the next challenge, you will demonstrate that you can create a node with the new label and properties in the graph.
