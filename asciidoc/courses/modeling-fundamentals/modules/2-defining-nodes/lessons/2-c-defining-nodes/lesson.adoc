= Identifying a New Node Label
:order: 2
:type: challenge
:usecase: blank-sandbox
:sandbox: true

Now for a challenge.

We have already identified the _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes for our domain questions:

. What *people* acted in a *movie*?
. What *person* directed a *movie*?
. What *movies* did a *person* act in?

We have an additional question that we must model for.

*Note*: As you go through this course, you can use any technique you want to for drawing out the graph data model.
Most people just use pen and paper.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills in identifying an additional node label for the graph data model.

The new data model is now:

In the next challenge, you will demonstrate that you can create a node with the new node label and properties in the graph.
