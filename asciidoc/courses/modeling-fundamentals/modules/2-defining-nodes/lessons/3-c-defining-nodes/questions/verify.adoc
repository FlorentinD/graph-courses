= Adding a new label to the model

What **label** do you add to support this use case:

  4: How many users rated a movie?

input::answer[]

* [x] User


[TIP]
====
We already have defined the labels _Movie_ and _Person_. We want to differentiate a *user* who rated movies from a *person* who acted in or directed movies.

Note also that in this course we will use CamelCase as a standard for our label names. That is, the label will begin with a capital letter.
