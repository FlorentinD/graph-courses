=== 2. Defining relationships

When you define relationships in the graph data model, what must you define?

* [x] The starting node (with label) for the relationship.
* [x] The ending node (with label) for the relationship.
* [ ] The number of nodes that will have that relationship in the graph.
* [x] The name (type) for the relationship.

[TIP]
====
A relationship must have a type and direction when it is created in the graph.
