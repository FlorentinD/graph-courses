= Creating Initial Relationships
:type: challenge
:order: 2
:sandbox: true

Here is the instance model you will be creating:

Each _ACTED_IN_ relationship here has a different value for the _role_ property.

Run this Cypher code to add the _ACTED_IN_ and _DIRECTED_ relationships to the graph:

[TIP]
Click the *Run in Sandbox* button to the top right of the code sample to open the Sandbox to the right create the nodes and relationships.

MATCH (apollo:Movie {title: 'Apollo 13'})
MATCH (tom:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
MATCH (meg:Person {name: 'Meg Ryan'})
MATCH (danny:Person {name: 'Danny DeVito'})
MATCH (sleep:Movie {title: 'Sleepless in Seattle'})
MATCH (hoffa:Movie {title: 'Hoffa'})
MATCH (jack:Person {name: 'Jack Nicholson'})
// create the relationships between nodes
MERGE (tom)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Jim Lovell'}]->(apollo)
MERGE (tom)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Sam Baldwin'}]->(sleep)
MERGE (meg)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Annie Reed'}]->(sleep)
MERGE (danny)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Bobby Ciaro'}]->(hoffa)
MERGE (danny)-[:DIRECTED]->(hoffa)
MERGE (jack)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Jimmy Hoffa'}]->(hoffa)

You can verify that the relationships have been created with this code:

----
MATCH (n) RETURN n

There should be a total of 6 relationships in the graph.

== Summary

In this challenge, you created some of the initial relationships to support our instance model.

In the next challenge, you will model a new relationship in the graph data model.
