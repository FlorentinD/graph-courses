Now for a challenge.

We have already identified the _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes  and the _ACTED_IN_ and _DIRECTED_ relationships for our domain questions:

. What people *acted* in a movie?
. What person *directed* a movie?
. What movies did a person *act* in?

We have an additional question that we must model for.

In this challenge, you demonstrated your skills in identifying the connections between the entities of the domain and defining the relationships for the graph data model.
In the next challenge, you will create new relationships in the graph.
