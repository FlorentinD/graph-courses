We want to add some relationships between _User_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes so we can test our model.

In this challenge, you will create _RATED_ relationships that include the _rating_ property.

Use the sandbox window to the right to create the _RATED_ relationship between these nodes with the _rated_ property as follows:

. [copy]#Sandy Jones# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Apollo 13# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#5#
. [copy]#Sandy Jones# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Sleepless in Seattle# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#4#
. [copy]#Clinton Spencer# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Apollo 13# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#3#
. [copy]#Clinton Spencer# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Sleepless in Seattle# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#3#
. [copy]#Clinton Spencer# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Hoffa# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#3#


[TIP]
--
Use `MATCH` to find the _User_ and _Movie_ nodes, then use `MERGE` to create the relationships between the two nodes.
Remember that you must specify or infer(left-to-right) a direction when you create a relationship.
You should create a total of 5 _RATED_ relationships in the graph, each with a property, _rating_.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create some relationships to support your instance model.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next module, you will learn why and how to refactor your data model.
