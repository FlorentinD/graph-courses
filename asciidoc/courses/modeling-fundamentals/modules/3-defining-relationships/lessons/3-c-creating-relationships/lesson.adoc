= Creating Relationships
:type: challenge
:order: 3
:usecase: blank-sandbox
:sandbox: true
:verify: MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]-(m:Movie) WHERE u.name IN ['Sandy Jones', 'Clinton Spencer'] AND u.userId IN [534,105] AND r.rating in [3,4,5] RETURN count(r) = 5 AS outcome

We want to add some relationships between _User_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes so we can test our model.

In this challenge, you will create _RATED_ relationships that include the _rating_ property.

Use the sandbox window to the right to create the _RATED_ relationship between these nodes with the _rated_ property as follows:

. [copy]#Sandy Jones# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Apollo 13# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#5#
. [copy]#Sandy Jones# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Sleepless in Seattle# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#4#
. [copy]#Clinton Spencer# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Apollo 13# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#3#
. [copy]#Clinton Spencer# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Sleepless in Seattle# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#3#
. [copy]#Clinton Spencer# [copy]#RATED# [copy]#Hoffa# with a [copy]#rating# of [copy]#3#


[TIP]
--
Use `MATCH` to find the _User_ and _Movie_ nodes, then use `MERGE` to create the relationships between the two nodes.
Remember that you must specify a direction when you create a relationship.
You should create a total of 5 _RATED_ relationships in the graph, each with a property, _rating_.

== Summary

In this challenge, you demonstrated that you can create some relationships to support your instance model.

Your instance model should now look like this:

In the next module, you will learn why and how to refactor your data model.
