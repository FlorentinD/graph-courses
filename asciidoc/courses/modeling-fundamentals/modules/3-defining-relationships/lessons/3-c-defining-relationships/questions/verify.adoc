* [x] RATED

[start=2]
. What property do you add to the relationship to support this use case?

* [x] rating


[TIP,role=hint]
====
We already have defined the relationships between _Person_ nodes and _Movie_ nodes.
What relationship can you define to connect User nodes to Movie nodes?

Hints:
A User *rated* a Movie, which is the relationship type. We call the value (property) for this relationship a *rating*.
We use uppercase for relationship types and camelCase (lowercase) for properties representing a value for the relationship.
