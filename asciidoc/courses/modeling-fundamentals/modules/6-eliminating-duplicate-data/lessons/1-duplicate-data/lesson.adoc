== Duplicate data

Duplicating data is not something that you should have in your graph.
This is in contrast to denormalized data in an RDBMS where data is duplicated so that it can be related in different tables for SQL access.
In Neo4j, you should strive to not duplicate data because it takes up space in the graph and it is typically not the fastest way to query the data.

=== New use case

We have a new use case that we must account for.

*11. What movies are available in a particular language?*

=== Duplicate data example

Here is an example.
Suppose we add a property to each _Movie_ node in the graph named _languages_ that represents the languages in which movie is available.

Here is what the instance model would look like:

image::images/languages-property-instance-model.png[Instance model with languages,width=400,align=center]

Here we see that all _Movie_ nodes have English in the list of languages.
This is duplicate data and for a scaled database, would represent a lot of duplication.

== Summary

In this lesson, you learned why it is important to eliminate duplication of data in the graph.
In the next challenge, you will add more data to your instance model as duplicate data so you can test the new use case.
