MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Keanu Reeves'
/*select:WITH m  LIMIT 3*/
MATCH (d:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
RETURN collect(d.name) as Directors, m.title AS Movies

* [ ] `WITH LIMIT 3`
* [x] `WITH m  LIMIT 3`
* [ ] `AND count(m) = 3`
* [ ] `LIMIT 3`

[TIP]
====
The `WITH` clause must carry forward the m variable and limit how many are carried forward.
