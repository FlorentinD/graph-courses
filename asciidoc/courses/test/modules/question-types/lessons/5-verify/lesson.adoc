= Database Verification
:order: 5

Verify that something has happened in the database.
When paired with the `:usecase:` attribute, this will the user's sandbox databases for one matching the use case, then run the query speficied in the `:verify:` attribute against that database.


Add a `verify.cypher` file to the lesson root.
The verify query should return one row with an `outcome` item.
If the outcome column doesn't exist, the verification will fail.
If the outcome column doesn't strictly equal true, the verification will fail.

----
// verify.cypher
RETURN true AS outcome

Then create a question in the `questions` folder.
The `:id:` attribute is required and needs to be set to `_challenge` specifically.
Don't ask me why.

:id: _challenge

Once you have run the query, click the **Check Database** button and we will check the database for you.
