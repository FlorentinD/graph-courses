= 2. Query using a pattern

Which `MATCH` clauses will return the names of the directors of the movie, _The Matrix_?

* [x] `+MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name+`
* [ ] `MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})--(p:Person) RETURN p.name`
* [x] `+MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})<-[:DIRECTED]-(p) RETURN p.name+`
* [ ] `MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})--(p:Director) RETURN p.name`

.Hint
====
The _Person_ nodes represent people and the relationship must be _DIRECTED_.

You don't necessarily need to define the `:Person` label for the node at the end of the pattern.

.Solution
====

The two options below are valid options for finding the people who directed The Matrix:

`MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name` +
`MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})<-[:DIRECTED]-(p) RETURN p.name`


In the following query, you will technically get the directors but because the relationship type or direction type is not defined, you will receive _all_ people connected to that movie, including anyone who acted in the movie through the `:ACTED_IN` relationship.

`MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})--(p:Person) RETURN p.name`

The following query will return nothing because our graph does not have a label, _Director_.

`MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})--(p:Director) RETURN p.name`
