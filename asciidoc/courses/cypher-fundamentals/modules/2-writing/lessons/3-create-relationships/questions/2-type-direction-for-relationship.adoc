=== 2. Using `MERGE` for relationships

Suppose you want to create the _LIKES_ relationship between a reference to a node _a_, and a reference to a node _b_ where the direction of the relationship is from _a_ to _b_.

Which statements below will create the _LIKES_ relationship from _a_ to _b_?

* [ ] `MERGE (a)-[LIKES]->(b)`
* [x] `MERGE (a)-[:LIKES]->(b)`
* [ ] `MERGE (a)-[LIKES]-(b)`
* [x] `MERGE (a)-[:LIKES]-(b)`

[TIP]
====
By default, `MERGE` will create the relationship in the left-to-right direction.
