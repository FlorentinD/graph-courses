=== 2. Using `MERGE` for relationships

When using `MERGE` to create a relationship, the query processor makes some assumptions about the pattern used for the `MERGE`.
Suppose you want to have the node on the left to be connected to the node on the right in the pattern.
What do you need *not* specify in the `MERGE` pattern?

* [ ] The number of nodes the relationship will connect.
* [ ] The type for the relationship.
* [x] The direction of the relationship.
* [ ] The references to the two nodes that will be connected.

[TIP]
====
You can only create relationships between existing nodes.
When you draw the property graph model on the whiteboard, you always specify these two characteristics of a relationship.
By default, `MERGE` will create the relationship in the left-to-right direction.
