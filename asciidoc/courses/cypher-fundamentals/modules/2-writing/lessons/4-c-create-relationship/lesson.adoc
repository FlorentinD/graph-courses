We want to make another addition to the graph.

Use the sandbox window to the right to add a new node and relationship to the graph:

. Find the _Person_ node for  [copy]#Daniel Kaluuya#.
. Create the _Movie_ node, [copy]#Get Out#.
. Add the [copy]#ACTED_IN# relationship between _Daniel Kaluuya_ and the movie, _Get Out_.

Remember that our other _Movie_ nodes contain a property called _title_.
