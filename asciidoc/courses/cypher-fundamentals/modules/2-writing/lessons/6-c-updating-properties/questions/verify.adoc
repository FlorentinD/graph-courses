verify::Check Movie Properties[]

[TIP]
====
Make sure the _Movie_ node exists for _Get Out_.
Use MATCH to find the _Movie_ node and then use SET to add the properties using the reference to the node.

You  can do a subsequent MATCH to confirm that the node's properties have been set:
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Get Out'})
RETURN m

If you view the node in table view, you will see the properties.

Hint: the released property is an integer, not a string.
