We discovered that we created the _Movie_ node for the movie _Get Out_, but we forgot to add the tagline which is _Gripping, scary, witty and timely!_ and the released year of 2017.

Write the Cypher code to find this _Movie_ node and add the _tagline_ and _released_ properties for the node.

In the link:../4-create-relationship-challenge/[Creating a Relationship] challenge, we created a new `Movie` node for the movie *Get Out*.  However, we forgot to add a a tagline or release year.

Use the Sandbox window to the right to add two new properties to the node:

* *`tagline`*: [copy]#Gripping, scary, witty and timely!#
* *`released`*: [copy]#2017#
