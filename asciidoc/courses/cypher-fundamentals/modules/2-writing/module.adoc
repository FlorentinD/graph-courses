First, you will use the `MERGE` clause to create nodes or relationships in the graph.
Then, you will learn how to set the properties for a node or relationship inline or with the `SET` keyword.

== Resetting the database

In this module you will be modifying the graph. In the next lessons and challenges, you will see a `RESET DATABASE` button you can click before you start a lesson or challenge if you need to make sure your database is compatible with where you should be in the lesson or challenge.
