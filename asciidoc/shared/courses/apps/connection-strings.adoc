== `1` The Connection String

A connection string typically consists of four elements:

image::{cdn-url}/img/courses/shared/connection-string.png[An example Neo4j Connection String: neo4j+s://dbhash.databases.neo4j.io:7687]

1. The **scheme** used to connect to the Neo4j instance - for example `neo4j` or `neo4j+s` (required)
2. The initial server address for the Neo4j DBMS - for example `localhost` or `dbhash.databases.neo4j.io` (required)
3. The **port number** that the DBMS is running on (required if the instance is not running on the default port of `7687`)
4. Additional connection configuration (for example the routing context)


=== Choosing your Scheme

Most likely, you will use a variation of the `neo4j` scheme within your connection string.

* `neo4j` - Creates an **unencrypted** connection to the DBMS.  If you are connecting to a local DBMS or have not explicitly turned on encryption then this is most likely the option you are looking for.
* `neo4j+s` - Creates an **encrypted** connection to the DBMS.  The driver will verify the authenticity of the certificate and fail to verify connectivity if there is a problem with the certificate.
* `neo4j+ssc` - Creates an encrypted connection to the DBMS, but will not attempt to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

Variations of the `bolt` scheme can be used to connect directly to a single DBMS within a clustered environment.  This can be useful if you have a single server configured for data science or analytics.

* `bolt` - Creates an unencrypted connection directly to a single DBMS.
* `bolt+s` - Creates an encrypted connection directly to a single DBMS and verify the certificate.
* `bolt+ssc` - Creates an encrypted connection to directly to a single DBMS but will not attempt to verify the authenticity of the certificate.



[TIP]
.Which scheme string is right for you?
====
You can https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/current/upgrade-driver/#_configure_ssl_policy_for_bolt_server_and_https_server[verify the encryption level of your DBMS^] by checking the `dbms.connector.bolt.enabled` key in `neo4j.conf`.

If you are connecting to a DBMS hosted on Neo4j Aura, you will always use the `neo4j+s` scheme.

=== Additional Connection Information

Additional connection information can be appended to the connection string after a `?`.
For example, in a multi-data centre cluster, you may wish to take advantage of locality to reduce latency and improve performance.

In this case, you could configure a routing policy for a set of application servers to connect to Neo4j instances that are within the same data centre.

For more information, see this link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/consideration-about-routing-tables-on-multi-data-center-deployments/[Knowledge Base Article: Consideration about routing tables on multi-data center deployments^].

// Neo4j also supports kerberos authentication tokens and can be extended to support custom authentication.
// These authentication methods require additional configuration and are outside of the scope of this course.

For more information on additional authentication methods, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/[Authentication and authorization^] section of the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/[Neo4j Operations Manual^].

== What happens next?

The driver will attempt to connect to the DBMS using the supplied credentials.
If everything is successful, the driver will then communicate with the DBMS and figure out the best way to execute each query.

You do not need to do any additional configuration when connecting to a single DBMS or a Neo4j cluster.
This means you do not have to adapt your application code, regardless of which environment you connect to.

Once the connection has been successfully made, your application can start to interact with the data in the graph.
